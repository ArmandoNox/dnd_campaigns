# Chapter Six: Blood in the Mountains

The session begins in the dark, rugged landscape of the **Troll Mountains**. The party stands over the gravely injured **Echo**, having just witnessed his first words—a worried query directed at **Saffi**, confirming that a profound new magic has taken hold. **Saffi** discovers decayed fingernails in **Echo**'s wounds, confirming a zombie attack. **Caelen Wymond** heals the wolf, allowing the team to continue their ascent.

The party tracks the undead through treacherous fog, eventually reaching the walls of the **Abandoned Church**. Skulls encrusted on the walls emit an eerie green light. **Caelen** casts _Silence_ to cover their entrance, and **Alamira Ayreys** sends **Whisper** to scout for traps.

**[Vital Discovery]**
Inside the desecrated halls, the party discovers a group of cultists—led by a robed dragonborn—commanding ghouls to "pull it down," apparently dismantling the remaining holy iconography to make room for mosaics of **Orcus**.

**_Combat Starts_**

**Saffi** and **Echo** coordinate an attack on the robed cultist. **Tra’Ahn Sparkscale** holds the line against the shuffling dead, while **Caelen** unleashes _Radiance of the Dawn_, vaporizing multiple zombies in a burst of holy light. **Alamira** provides cover with _Ray of Frost_, and the cultist leader is eventually finished off by **Echo**.

**_Combat Ends_**

The party discovers a series of hidden passages. In one, they find a statue of a vampire hiding a magical wand.

**_Combat Starts_**

As they attempt to leave the hidden room, the skeletal remains of past cultists rise to block their path. One skeleton, wreathed in green fire, nearly kills **Tra’Ahn** with an explosion. **Saffi** and **Tra’Ahn**'s "Last Stand" coordinate to bring down the fiery undead and the archers in the back.

**_Combat Ends_**

Deeper in the church, the party enters a jail block. While investigating a bed in one of the cells, **Tra’Ahn** finds a magical whip.

**[Vital Discovery]**
**Alamira** discovers a **Wand of Secrets** hidden behind a loose brick in the central cell. However, her exploration triggers the awakening of a spectral guardian.

**_Combat Starts_**

A **Wraith** emerges from a pile of bones, its touch draining the very life force of **Tra’Ahn** and **Alamira**. Because the creature is incorporeal, **Saffi**'s physical arrows find little purchase. **Alamira** eventually saves the day, landing a heavy blow with a _Cold Chromatic Orb_ that shatters the spirit's essence.

**_Combat Ends_**
