# Chapter Five: The Confectioner's Kitchen

The session begins as the party stands in the doorway of the kitchen, facing **"Uncle" Nibblecheek** and his golden dragon companion. The air is thick with the smell of sweets and an underlying, rotten odor. **"Uncle"** takes immediate notice of the party's candy forms, smelling "desires" from **Tra’Ahn Sparkscale** and "secrets" from **Saffi Muddleblossom**.

**Tra’Ahn** explains their purpose and asks if the dragon is **Brioche Bane**. **"Uncle"** becomes defensive, shifting closer to the dragon. **Alamira Ayreys** uses _Detect Thoughts_, sensing **"Uncle"**’s excitement at the prospect of a "deal." He offers to let them go—for a price. He wants **Tra’Ahn**’s name, **Caelen**’s faith, and **Alamira**’s knowledge... permanently.

**[Vital Discovery]**
**Saffi** observes **Brioche Bane** and realizes the golden dragon is suspiciously subservient, its gaze blank. **Tra’Ahn**, knowing golden dragons value fairness and knowledge, realizes this is unnatural. **Alamira** sends her spirit fox, **Whisper**, to investigate the basement, where she finds **Asgerd** trapped in a candy cage, guarded by gingerbread men.

When **Tra’Ahn** attempts to speak to **Brioche** in Draconic, **"Uncle"** loses his patience and attacks.

**_Combat Starts_**

**Saffi** casts _Hunter’s Mark_ on **"Uncle"** and lands a blow. **Caelen Wymond** moves to support, but **"Uncle"** attempts to bite him with a set of flimsy, old dentures. **Tra’Ahn** lands a severe hit with **Leafwarden**. The dragon, **Brioche Bane**, unleashes a breath of fire that temporarily knocks **Caelen** down. **Echo** loops around to attack **"Uncle"** from behind, and **Tra’Ahn** delivers a weakening blow.

**_Combat Ends_**

Facing defeat, **"Uncle"** declares a truce. He agrees to liberate the party from their cookie forms and release **Brioche Bane**. The party, recovering their human shapes, chooses to leave the house rather than intervene further in **Enid**’s dark deal with her brother.

Returning to **Hobbletown**, the party visits **Fill's Bakery**. They discover that **Fill** is actually a retired bandit who raised **Brioche Bane** from an egg. In a tender moment, **Tra’Ahn** places the **Brass Dragon Egg** on **Brioche**'s small hoard. The egg glows brilliantly, infusing itself with the essence of a gold dragon.

The party later uses their magical artifacts to summon their island tower estate, placing it off the coast of **Cloakwood**. As they rest in their new home, they receive a collective vision of a silver-haired host in **Greysmere**.

They travel south through **Beregost** and **Nashkel**, reaching the **Troll Mountains**. There, they meet **Orion Solaris** at **Death’s Bane Tavern**. He explains that a cult of **Orcus** has been stealing supplies and digging up corpses. The party agrees to help, tracking a zombie through the night. The session ends in tragedy and wonder as they find **Echo** gravely injured—but for the first time, everyone can clearly understand the wolf's words: “Is **Saffi** Okay?”
