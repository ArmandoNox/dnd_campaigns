# Chapter One: An Egg, an Oath, and a Blighted Wood

The threads of fate drew four disparate travelers together in a humble caravan. The cheerful gnome ranger, Saffi Muddleblossom, served as a guide for the timid high elf wizard, Alamira Ayreys, who had left the hallowed halls of Candlekeep to continue her studies in the wider world. Joining them were the stoic dragonborn fighter, Tra’Ahn Sparkscale, and the human cleric, Caelen Wymond, a young man who looked to the dragonborn as a mentor. Though their destinations differed, their paths were, for a time, intertwined.

That path was violently rerouted when a tempest of unnatural fury descended upon them. Through the lashing rain and cracking thunder, the travelers witnessed a terrifying spectacle: two dragons locked in a deadly battle across the storm-wracked sky. A bolt of lightning, whether from the heavens or a dragon's maw, shattered their caravan, forcing the four to seek refuge in a nearby cave.

There, they found a dying humanoid, their life fading fast. With their last breath, they pressed a heavy, warm object into the heroes' hands: a magnificent brass dragon egg, said to be the last from the line of Cozmioko. "Trust the egg to guide you," the stranger whispered, their voice a mere rustle of leaves before falling silent forever. Respectfully, the heroes used their magic to return the stranger's body to the earth, a quiet farewell to the one who set them on their path.

Drawn by an unseen force, Tra’Ahn Sparkscale reached out and touched the egg. A powerful vision flooded his mind: six colossal redwood trees, a small village of huts nestled between them, and a skeleton so vast it could be a village itself. The name echoed in his thoughts: Red Wood Watch.

With this divine guidance, the party's course was set. Their journey to the forest was calm, a stark contrast to the storm that had forged their fellowship. While Tra'Ahn and Caelen remained focused on the sacred mission, their companions found their own interests. Saffi reveled in the vibrant nature around them, while Alamira’s scholarly curiosity was piqued by whispers of a legendary magical sword named Leafwarden, said to be lost in the region.

Upon arriving at Red Wood Watch, they were met by two of the village's three council members, Celanar Woodrise and Gwenhomara Woodrise. Mistaking the party for mercenaries answering their plea for aid, they quickly explained the dire situation. The forest had become unnaturally blighted, its inherent poisonous nature growing more deadly by the day. Five villagers had been lost to it: first, the third council member, Armin, who had ventured to the Redwood Grove seeking answers, and then four others who went searching for him.

Without hesitation, the heroes agreed to help. Their first task, the council explained, was to gather a piece of bark from each of the six great Redwood trees—each originally planted by one of six great elven families ages ago—to create an inoculation against the forest's encroaching blight.

As they prepared, the party spoke with the villagers, including the local innkeeper Fergus, to gather threads of local lore. They learned of the great hero Ethvarn, who fell centuries ago fighting a green dragon known as Death at Sunset, and confirmed that her lost sword, Leafwarden, may still lie in the dragon's old lair. More recent and disturbing rumors also surfaced—sightings of a strange, green-skinned man with hair of leaves, and of malevolent, walking trees with sharpened limbs, which Saffi suspected might be corrupted Dryads. The heroes stood ready, the fate of a village resting on their shoulders and the secret of a dragon egg held in their hands.
