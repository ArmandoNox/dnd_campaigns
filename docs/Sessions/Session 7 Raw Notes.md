# Chapter Seven: The Crypt of the Arch-Lich

The session begins moments after the destruction of the **Wraith** in the jail cells. The team is battered but victorious, catching their breath in the silent, dusty room, fully committed to navigating the remaining threats of the **Abandoned Church**.

While exploring the hallways, **Saffi Muddleblossom** discovers a skeleton that appears to have been running away, holding a locket. Inside, **Caelen Wymond** finds a scroll of _Animate Dead_, which he passes to an eager **Alamira Ayreys**.

**[Vital Discovery]**
The party stumbles upon a dining room where they find **Yondis**, a living man who has been pretending to be a zombie for years. Through **Yondis**, they learn about the cult's hierarchy: **Zia** (the leader), **Eleith** (the dwarf in charge of the library), and the ghost **Melindra**. **Yondis** also reveals that the "Wand of Orcus" they found earlier was actually a prank placed by **Eleith**.

After sending **Yondis** back to **Greysmere** with a letter of recommendation for employment, the party ambushes **Eleith** in the library.

**_Combat Starts_**

**Tra’Ahn Sparkscale** and **Echo** drag the dwarf into a bubble of _Silence_. **Alamira** is nearly killed in the initial exchange, but once **Caelen** demonstrates the power of **Helm**, **Eleith**'s reality is shattered. He realizes that **Zia** lied about the gods being dead.

**_Combat Ends_**

Weeping, **Eleith** agrees to help the party take down **Zia**. He leads them to the central chamber, where **Zia** stands surrounded by an army of zombies.

**_Combat Starts_**

As the battle erupts, a booming voice—purportedly **Orcus**—demands to know if the party is there to kill **Zia**. When **Alamira** confirms, a small dragon wyrmling named **Nezzerem** emerges from behind a statue and eagerly joins the fray. **Caelen** wipes out the zombie horde with _Channel Divinity_, and **Tra’Ahn** and **Saffi** deliver the final blows to **Zia**.

**_Combat Ends_**

With **Zia**'s death, **Eleith** also passes away, his life having been tied to her necromancy. **Nezzerem** introduces himself, revealing that he had been manipulating the cultists for his own amusement. He agrees to allow the party to place the **Brass Dragon Egg** in his hoard.

**[Vital Discovery]**
As the egg touches the hoard, the party is once again knocked unconscious, waking up stronger and more attuned to the egg's growing power. The session ends as the party takes a short rest in the cultist's old quarters, surrounded by newfound treasures including **Bracers of Archery** and a **Malachite Skull**.
