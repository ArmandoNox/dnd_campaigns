# Chapter Four: The Burning of Hobbletown

The session begins as the heroes rush towards **Hobbletown**, the vision from the dragon egg becoming a terrifying reality. The air is thick with smoke, the sounds of crackling flames and desperate screams replacing the peace of the countryside.

We rush towards a house engulfed in flames. **Alamira Ayreys** tries to create a small opening in the fire for the others to enter. **Tra’ahn Sparkscale** rushes through the door, shattering it and moving inside. He notices an elderly halfling woman inside—the source of the screams. He grabs her and safely runs outside.

**Caelen Wymond** goes in in his place to save anyone else. He grabs the money from the till and a picture frame before exiting. Meanwhile, **Saffi Muddleblossom** notices a well and has **Echo** grab a bucket. Using _Druidcraft_, she manage to put out the fire, and the building thankfully still stands.

The survivors approach, celebrating. The elderly halfling, **Enid Appleguard**, is incredibly thankful that her candy store was saved. She is puzzled by the fire, as there was no reason for a blaze to start in her shop. **Alamira** casts _Detect Magic_, but finds nothing immediate. **Enid** mentions she is new in town, having only been around for a few months. She points the party toward a rival bakery in town that makes "cinnabons"—a half-eaten one was found at the scene.

**[Vital Discovery]**
**Tra’ahn** hears rumors from a "drunk" lady about "flying, fire-breathing cows." Investigating the direction she pointed, **Alamira** finds singed grass. **Saffi** tracks the movement deeper into the forest, noticing that the foliage and trees in this area don't seem to belong to the local ecosystem—suggesting Fae interference or a dragon wyrmling with a sweet tooth.

The party eventually encounters a house made entirely of candy. Inside, they discover a kid's room with a massive cradle labeled "**Bubblewoga**." After a series of traps—including a magical rug and a rolling pin that temporarily turns **Alamira** and **Caelen** into flat, cookie-like versions of themselves—they fight their way through the house.

**_Combat Starts_**

The party is attacked by the magical rug guarding the entrance. **Tra’ahn** successfully frees **Saffi** from its grapple and manages to toss the rug aside, allowing the party to secure the interior.

**_Combat Ends_**

Deeper in the house, they encounter three bears working as bakers. When negotiations fail, combat breaks out.

**_Combat Starts_**

**Tra’ahn** attempts to hold the door, but a bear manages to shove him into a taffy machine. **Alamira** uses _Phantasmal Force_ to confuse the bears and commands her new **Panther** pet (from a magical satchel) to attack. **Saffi** and **Echo** coordinate strikes, eventually taking the bears out of commission.

**_Combat Ends_**

**Tra’ahn** emerges from the taffy machine converted into candy—flexible, sweet-smelling, and looking like a gingerbread man. In the farm out back, they find four "**Choco-trices**" guarding statues of people frozen in chocolate.

**_Combat Starts_**

**Caelen** melts the choco-trices with radiant energy, while **Alamira** freezes one solid with _Ray of Frost_. **Tra’ahn** and **Saffi** finish the remaining creatures with ease.

**_Combat Ends_**

In a tower library, the group finds a storybook revealing **Enid Appleguard**'s past: she traded her brother **Asgerd** to "**Uncle Nibblecheek**" for an unlimited supply of candy. They also find a magical flying broom and a pair of sentient dentures.

Finally, they reach the kitchen, guarded by the wood-baby cyclops **Bubblewoga**. They bribe him with a candy apple, allowing them to enter. Within, they find **Uncle Nibblecheek** standing beside a small golden dragon.
