# Chapter Nine: The Astral Gate

The session begins on the first floor of the **Starglass Waypoint**. Having befriended the small **Modron** in the kitchen and secured a security sigil, the party stands before the metallic doors leading to the west.

The party ascends to the second floor, discovered via **Alamira Ayreys**'s identification of a teleportation circle. While scouting the garden area, **Tra’Ahn Sparkscale** and **Caelen Wymond** are ambushed by massive, predatory plant-creatures.

**_Combat Starts_**

The vines grapple and nearly absorb **Caelen**. **Tra’Ahn** holds the line while **Saffi Muddleblossom** and **Alamira** coordinate from across the catwalks. **Alamira** utilizes _Misty Step_ to gain position, and **Tra’Ahn** eventually hacks the cleric free.

**_Combat Ends_**

**[Vital Discovery]**
In the waypoint's control room, the party encounters a **Githyanki** warrior who dismisses the facility as an "abandoned outpost." She destroys the communication console and teleports away, leaving the party to deal with the dragon **Ylaglan**.

Further exploration leads the party to the luxury suites, where they find a winged kobold named **Bobson** living out of a tent. **Bobson** reveals that the dragon went on a "rampage" after someone stole from its hoard. Specifically, **Bobson** admits to stealing a "simple dagger" (and the party trades for his **Ring of Jumping**).

**_Combat Starts_**

An **Earth Elemental** ambushes the group near the bazaar. **Alamira** successfully confuses the creature with _Phantasmal Force_, allowing **Saffi** and **Tra’Ahn** to bring it down without further injury to the team.

**_Combat Ends_**

The party finally confronts **Ylaglan** at the **Astral Gate**. The dragon, initially suspicious, is eventually provoked into a paranoid rage.

**_Combat Starts_**

**Ylaglan** unleashes a sleep breath, knocking out most of the party. **Alamira** and **Tra’Ahn** manage to stay awake, with **Tra’Ahn** utilizing the dragon-slaying properties of **Leafwarden** to severely wound the beast. **Alamira** strikes with a powerful _Witch Bolt_, and **Tra’Ahn** knocks the dragon unconscious with a shield bash.

**_Combat Ends_**

**[Vital Discovery]**
The party discovers that the "thief" stealing the dragon's gold was actually a **Bag of Devouring**—a cursed item that mimics a bag of holding but devours everything placed inside. This realization explains the dragon's madness.

The session ends with the party successfully infusing the **Brass Dragon Egg** and returning to **The Nest** via a **Githyanki** portal, bringing several **Modron** allies with them to serve as the tower's new caretakers.
