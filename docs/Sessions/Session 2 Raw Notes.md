# Chapter Two: The Blighted Grove

Armed with six empty vials, the heroes ventured into the **Redwood Grove**. The area opened into a hexagonal clearing, with five of the six great trees visible. A murky, poisoned stream sluggishly cut through the grove, its sickly waters bubbling with a foul energy.

As the party began their task, **Caelen Wymond** spotted strange, burrowing insects boring into the bark of a tree. His investigation led him to a cluster of still forms scattered among the roots—the discolored corpses of travelers. As the party drew close, they noticed a set of familiar tracks in the mud: those of a hunter's boots and a large wolf. Suddenly, the corpses began to twitch, rising with an unholy light in their eyes.

**_Combat Starts_**

The party moved as one. **Tra’Ahn Sparkscale** charged the nearest zombie, while **Alamira Ayreys** sent rays of frost arcing over the battlefield. **Saffi Muddleblossom** loosed arrows with deadly precision, and **Caelen** unleashed a wave of divine energy that turned two of the undead to dust. The remaining horrors were quickly dispatched.

**_Combat Ends_**

Continuing their work near the stream, a swarm of giant, venomous centipedes erupted from the soil. **Tra'Ahn** met them with a spray of lightning, and **Caelen** crushed those that scuttled near him while healing his companions. **Alamira**'s magic missiles and **Saffi**'s twin strikes wiped out the remaining vermin.

Across the poisoned stream, they approached the fifth tree, where they met **Caynen**, a Dryad protector. He warned them that the blight was no simple sickness—it bled from the old lair of **Death at Sunset**, where a "wormling" had taken root. After a brief skirmish with a venomous snake, **Caynen** allowed them to take a sample. The final tree was guarded by mud mephits that erupted in explosions of muck upon their defeat, leaving **Tra'Ahn** and **Caelen** temporarily coated in sludge.

Curious about the legends of the sword **Leafwarden**, the party investigated the central mound, but found no trace of the blade. Before returning to town, **Alamira**’s curiosity led them to the lair's entrance. There, they found the hunter's tracks again and were confronted by **Armin** and his wolf, **Fletcher**.

**Standoff at the Lair**
A tense skirmish broke out, but **Alamira** pleaded for calm. **Armin** revealed he was being blackmailed by the wormling to guard the nest, lest the creature poison the entire village. Realizing they were unprepared for the toxic depths, the party retreated to town to plan.

After preparing with supplies from **Sunny** and drinking inoculation potions, the heroes returned to the lair. Inside, they rescued the four missing villagers, who revealed that **Armin** had known they were there but was forced to leave them. Deep in a side chamber, they encountered **Marilisaa**, a serpentine servant of the wormling.

**_Combat Starts_**

**Marilisaa** and her giant snake companion struck with vicious speed, nearly felling **Alamira**. **Tra’Ahn** cleaved the snake in two, and **Caelen** kept the party standing with timely healing. **Saffi**'s arrows and a devastating icy spell from **Alamira** finally shattered **Marilisaa** into a thousand pieces.

**_Combat Ends_**

As the party moved deeper, they stumbled upon the ancient, decaying corpse of a dragon. A disembodied voice echoed through the cavern, speaking a direct threat to the heroes. The session ended on this chilling note.
