# Chapter Eight: Nine Hoards Remain

The session begins as the team awakens in the silent, newly-secured quarters of the **Abandoned Church**. The feeling of the **Golden Dragon**'s power pulses faintly from **Eggsmirelda**, a reminder that the great journey is far from over.

The party returns to the tavern in **Greysmere**. **Orion Solaris** greets them as heroes, providing the 200 gold bounty and supplies. In a fit of generosity—and much to the chagrin of the party—**Tra’Ahn Sparkscale** gifts a valuable 750g statue to the barkeep for "decoration."

**[Vital Discovery]**
Upon returning to their tower (playfully named **"The Nest"**), the party encounters **Thalamil**, a young elf sent by **Alamira**'s father. This encounter prompts **Alamira Ayreys** to share her backstory with the group. The party also discovers that the tower's basement contains a fully functional **Teleportation Circle**, a **Scribing Station**, and an **Alchemy Area**.

On the fourth day of rest, the party receives a collective vision of a massive dark dragon destroying a metallic, clockwork-like structure in a canyon. The vision ends with a flash of the tower's teleportation circle.

Stepping into the circle, the party is whisked away to the desert region of **Calimshan**. They arrive in the ruins of a tower and hear the disembodied voice of **Keliphond**, who warns them of a dragon and points them toward a metallic city.

**[Vital Discovery]**
The party discovers the **Starglass Waypoint**, a stunning crystal and metal atrium built across a canyon. While investigating a pristine fountain, **Saffi** is ambushed by a **Water Elemental**.

**_Combat Starts_**

The creature nearly kills **Saffi** in a surprise rush. **Tra’Ahn** and **Alamira** coordinate their attacks, with **Alamira** using _Ray of Frost_ to slow the elemental. **Caelen** brings **Saffi** back with a well-timed heal, and **Saffi** delivers the killing shot.

**_Combat Ends_**

Deeper in the waypoint, the party encounters **Modrons**—robotic beings from another plane—hiding in fear.

**_Combat Starts_**

Mistaking the party for thieves, a group of **Modrons** and a **Mimic** (disguised as a crate) attack. **Tra’Ahn**'s _Comprehend Languages_ allows him to understand their fearful cries. The party is forced to defend themselves, but **Tra’Ahn** is dismayed when the mechanical beings disintegrate upon "death."

**_Combat Ends_**

The party eventually parleys with a **Spectator** guarding the library and a "little robot" in the kitchen. They learn that the dragon (initially a **Brass Dragon**, now possibly something else) has been indiscriminately attacking the **Modrons**. The "little robot" provides a **Security Sigil** keycard, granting access to the **Security Room** on the second floor.
