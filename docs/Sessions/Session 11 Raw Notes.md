# Chapter Eleven: Dragon of Nashkir [Click to Edit Title]

_(Your notes begin here...)_


Caelen attempts to figure out what temple/monastery was seen from the vision.  He eventually figures out that it is that the monastery is located in the Sea of Swords. He thinks that it is the Nagkir Monastery 

Tra'ahn suggest to Caelen to let Arlen take back Cleo's body to the clan so that attempt to revive her from her remains and thus Arlen is redeemed in the eyes of Tra'ahn's clan. Tra'ahn further suggest that Caelen's should send a message to the clan to let them know Arlen is coming. Alternatively, Saffi suggest asking the clan to send an envoy to make sure Arlen does indeed go to the clan. 
Tra'ahn thinks that his family might be able to get their connections to allow them to use a teleportation circle to come pick up Arlen by using the teleportation circle in the basement of the tower. 
Caelen determines to use the "Sending" spell to attempt to contact he spiritual head of the temple/monastery of Tra'ahn's clan. A female gnome, Zinxi Zarqerenos (Zisi), in the land of Cormyr. (Tra'ahn is a Count, minor nobility). 
Caelen uses "Sending" spell to contact Zisi.
"We found the remains of Cleo. Arlen is here. We are going to hold Arlen and her remains until you can come to get them"
She responds -
"Well done Watcher, please transmit your location as soon as possible" 
Caelen's explains that they are currently off the coast of Cloakwood with further messages via "Sending" spell. 
Caelen also sends a message to his mother to let her know that he is okay and about his father coming back. She responds surprised to hear from him, and says it's nice to hear from him. 


In the meantime, Tra'ahn asks Alamira to Identify the magical attributes of Cleo's armor. It didn't have anything particularly special, but Alamira identifies that it is a little more sturdy than normal armor. 
But Tra'ahn doesn't think i would be much of an improvement over his current armor. 

Given sent the message, the party goes back to figuring out how to get to the monastery. 
They determine their next stop has to be Baldur's Gate to resupply and get a ship. 
Before heading out, Tra'ahn tells the guards in the Barracks to keep an eye out at Arlen and to be aware of Tra'ahns Clan arrival to come get him and Cleo's remains. 
Tra'ahn also informs Arlen about the inminent arrival and his possibility for redemption. 
Arlen bows. 
"Whatever is the results, I'll accept my judgment"
"I expect you'll be honest and forthright, treat my aunts remains with respect" 
As for his son, Arlen seems sad upon seeing Caelen's body language and general distance and lack of interest in talking to him, but he respects his son and maintains a distance. 
Saffi tries to tell Arlen to take family therapy to work through their issues. While Arlen didn't quite understand the entire purpose, he seemed to be open to the idea and a little more hopeful. 

The party then rests for the day and early morning makes their way to Baldur's Gate. 

Mostly sticking to the roads, weather got a little more gloomy, but otherwise uneventful journey.
The party proceeds to leave their horses at a stable near the docks which Saffi takes care of and Alamira joins her. Meanwhile Tra'ahn and Caelen goes to find safe passage to the Sea of Swords. 

Arriving at the port, they see many ships and look around for someone. Without much luck early on, most people say no. While another one chuckles and says he's not going there, least of all after the dragon attacks. And generally sailors are avoiding the area. However, he also mentions that Mirel might be willing, and to look for her in the sea side tavern the Smiling Fish. 

Caelen and Tra'ahn ask for her at the bar, and after waiting briefly the bartender points to a woman in the corner, at this Tra'ahn asks for 3 beers and then approaches her with Caelen. 
She's curious who's she's making an aquantance with today. 
Tra'ahn introduces himself, and she immediately recognizes the Sparkscales which catches Tra'ahn by surprise. Mirel Astafar, a noble merchant who's family has had dealings with the Sparkscales. Caelen and Tra'ahn recognize her last name, not because they knew each other, but rather knew each other by the general dealings between the two families. 

Upon this, Tra'ahn shifts to a more formal tone and explains their situation. Tra'ahn is honored to meet her and tells her that his father has spoken about her. 
"If I had to guess, this has nothing to do with our normal business. You are both on the "path"?"
You know our business well. We require passage to Nashkir. 
I don't know why you seek passage there, but I do need people that go in hat direction. 
I am on a ship called the Way of Monks, usually used for transportation of goods. 
My friend Debbie was traveling to Nashkir, but a bronze dragon attacked her ship and the ship was sinked. 
Tra'ahn acknolwedges that bronze dragons can be a little territorial and aggressive, but usually not to this extent.
Most of the crew was unfortunately killed, but Debbie survived and made it to shore and is with the monks. 
Currently her ship, the "Wavemont" is being retrofitted to be more defensible, but she has no travelers willing to go there. 
Tra'ahn offers to pay for for the journey, but she tells them if that she would instead pay them if brought Debbie back safe. 
They come to an agreement. 
She tells them that the monks made apologies for the dragons, but have given no more details. They only claim that the dragon is protecting something. 
Just in case, they have a treasure chest if possible, and needed to bargain with the dragon. 
Tra'ahn asks if she's not coming, but she claims she usually pays for this kind of thing. and stays out of danger. 
Tra'ahn asked when the ship will be ready, and she tells them that it will be ready in a day. 
She offers them to pay for their lodging until the ship is ready.  
After having ironed out the details, they simply share a drink and chat about their backgrounds, families, and general life experiences. 
----
In the meanwhile Saffi and Alamira go to the stables to take care of their horses. 
They are able to find a stable not too far from the docks. They are given a fair price of a silver a day. Saffi tells the stable hand to take good care of Mistbane and Stormhoof. The stable dwarven female tells them that if they take more than a month she will sell them forward. Saffi gives her an initial 5 silver pieces and tells her that they will be back for the horses before the month. 

Shortly after as they're looking around, both Saffi and Alamira hear Echo say "No Danger". Which takes both Saffi and Alamira by surprise. Saffi tries to see if the Stable hand could hear him too. 
Alamira meanwhile tries to get him to talk but Echo simply approaches her bags of rations for a treat.
Which after some persuasion, he once again speaks and Alamira excitedly gives him the treat. 
At this point Saffi casts her spell to speak to animals, and tries figure out if Echo will say something else. While this is happening, she hears a horse say "False Wolf"
Alamira questions Saffi about Echo being a druid. Which Saffi's surprised that she hasn't mentioned it before. 
But Saffi tells her they can speak about it later. 
After this, Caelen sends a Sending message to Alamira about their location, and the party meets up at the Smiling Fish. 

Tra'ahn fills the girls into the details, and Alamira tells them "Is it too late to say I don't know how to swim?" 
Saffi's surprised, but alamira reminds her she's a bookwork, and likes solid ground. 
Saffi wonders about the ship's safety, but Caelen tells her the ship will have Ballistae and other defenses, but that the goal is not to hurt the dragon but to negotiate with it.  

Saffi then tells Caelen (while Tra'ahn is briefly gone to get drinks) about Echo talking to Alamira. Caelen is rather surprised about this but Saffi tells him that Echo used to be a druid. 
When Tra'ahn finally comes back, Saffi picks up the story again. 
She explains that in mossfield grove a town consisting of Halflings and some druids, and Echo was her best friend and they were supposed to get married. He was the son of the leader of the grove. He was a Druid in training. Echo was getting a lot of visions while he was in a druid like pilgrimage, but he was never able to turn back from his animal form. After talking to his dad for a while, and trying to figure out what was wrong with him and she decided to travel to other towns with druids to seek their help, and ultimately led her to Candlekeep where she met Alamira, but never found any answers. 
Saffi seemed surprised that they never wondered about this even when Echo could transform. The rest of the party explains that they just assumed he was some sort of fantastical/magical creature. 

The party sympathises with Saffi and Echo's situation and offer to help in any way they can. 
Saffi points to her earring, and tells them it's a crystallized tear from the last time she cried over Echo's situation. 
the other 3 ponder about how they might be able to help her, and if they could find a way to reverse what they -think- could be a curse. 

The party keeps chatting away, gets some food and drinks, and generally has a good time before calling it for a day. 

--- Next day

Tra'ahn suggest they make their way to a bakery, and then Alamira also mentions her need for some casting ingredients. Tra'ahn and Alamira try to jaggle with the salesperson but Tra'ahn fails to do so, and Alamira simply stutters. 

the party then makes their way to the ship, a Teafling captain. As they approach, Captain Orso, she greets them warmly. "You must be the party that is coming with us. Welcome to the Wavemont"
She asks if they've been debried of the possible dangers of the dragons, and Tra'ahn tells her they're aware. 
She asks if they need anything specific for their accomodations, but the party is satisfied with the basic things in a room. 

The team sails away. 
The next morning they're welcomed to the Captain's quarter with some breakfast and Tra'ahn's and the Captain Orso share stories and how seafarers tend to exaggerate their stories in general. 

Tra'ahn shares with them as a reminder that Bronze dragons are lighting dragons, thus they are resistant and breath lightning. They love the sea, and they can swim and stay underwater. 

All this time Alamira is livid. Given her lack of swimming skills and the very high chances of them getting attacked by a dragon, she's not too happy about the situation. 

Later on, the party separates around the ship. Saffi goes up the crows nest, where Echo has transformed into a colorful eagle circling the ship and ocasionally Echo screams "Saffi Safe!" which only Saffi can understand. 

As the party is approaching land, though foggy, they can start making sense of the shape of the land. 

As they're preparing to disembark, and the captain is explaining to them about making their way to the island, just a short distance from the ship a large bronze dragon erupts from the water. 

Tra'ahn immediately raises his arms and attempts to parley with him in draconic. While Captain Orso tells someone to bring the treasure chest to the deck. 

Almost breathing lighting on the ship it briefly stops and flies down closer to the ship to get near Tra'ahn. 
"Leave" the dragon roars and immediately takes a deep breaths and breathes a large strong gust of wind that shakes the ship. Blowing away two of the crew members off the ship. 

***Combat Starts***

Saffi yells "We are not here to fight!" while she holds on tightly to the crow's nest. 

Tra'ahn pulls out Eggmirelda "We bear the last heir of Kozmioko, we are not here to fight!

The dragon seems taken by surprise and and stops charging his breath attack, but still seems to be on the offensive. 
The dragon moves closer to the middle of the ship and does a air breath again, tossing 2 more crew members and Caelen and Alamira as well. 
After this, the dragon immediately charges his breath attack again with lightining exactly to the middle of the ship damaging it heavily. 

Alamira immediately misty steps back unto the ship in panic as she's falling to the water surface, and casts Blade Ward to defend herself. 

Caelen then stands on the water surface (having previously casted Walk on Water on 10 crew members including alamira) and then immediately rushes back to the ship. 

As this happens, most of the crew members make their way down below deck to the ship's hold. 

Meanwhile the captain yelling "Cowards" at the crew members, gets on a Ballista ready to fire but holds off. 

Tra'ahn rushes back to face the dragon and tells him that we will leave, but it needs to allow us to bring the crew back on board so we can turn the ship around. 

"Steer away or I will return" the dragon roars. 

***Combat Ends***

The crew blown overboard, thanks for the water walking easily make their way up. As everybody get their bearings, the dragon flew away, but keeps watch for us to leave. 
Tra'ahn thinks the dragon is acting out of necessity so we shouldn't fully leave. 
Alamira asks if they want to consult the cards and what kind of question should they divine upon to try and get their answers. Tra'ahn is unsure, but suggests possibly asking if we can bribe the dragon to get to the island. Tra'ahn it certain it came to attack, but the dragon is holding back because of the words we spoke. 
"Ask if we can bribe the dragon for safe passage". 

Alamira draws the cards and tells them the following: "Would bribing the dragon allow us safe passage?" 
As the people nearby watch Alamira casting the spell, and the cards that came out were the Skull, the tower and (something else negative, I forgot to write it down). Alamira quickly, and scared shuffle them back in. "nop! That is a horrible idea!" 

Saffi then suggest utilizing the mists as cover as the ship  is turning around while they use their water walking. 

Saffi then casts "Pass without a trace" to obscure the party as they get off the ship and walk over the water as they sprint towards the island. 

Thankfully, the dragon doesn't seem to notice them and the party makes it to the island safely. as the boat turned aruond, then the dragon also turns around and flies further into the island. 

Alamira's fear of the water pounding in her chest they finally make it to the shore. 
They spot the monastery and while Alamira and Saffi both eagerly look at the nearby mountain goats, they know they can't go pat them. 
They instead make their way to entrance of the monastery. Carved out of the rocks of the solid mountain, in a fashion resembling bricks. 

They find an Oak door, with a knocked in the shape of a sheeps head. And they see above the door the carving "Enter in peace". Tra'ahn uses the knocker to knock on the door. 

Shortly after, the door heavy large door slowly opens, where they see a young human dressed in monks robes. 
Tra'ahn greets him and explains they're here to see the Grand Master. The monk is surprised to see new travelers, and tells them to follow him. 

Meanwhile Caelen looks around and notices that the monastery doesn't seem to worship a deity of any sort, but rather is simply a place of peace. 

As they walk through the monastery, they see monks meditating, and others walking around. 

The Young Master, still very surprised. Asks if the party had arrived magically. 
Tra'ahn explains that they had arrived by ship, and that they were attacked by the bronze dragon. And asks if he's a friend or foe. 
Skalathas, the monk claims is his name, and that the dragon has been around for many years and that only recently started to attack. 
As they enter a large room that appeared to be in the middle of a temple, they see large statues of mountain goes that give a vibe of Wisdom. There they spot several monks wearing their robes in peaceful meditation, but turn around when the party enters the room, wide eyed and surprises to see them. 
One person in the middle, that appeared to be the leader, an Azimir that was unusually hunched over. Welcomes then "Enter in Peace, friends". 
Tra'ahn introduces himself and the party. And asks what do they worship here. 
He responds it's for the seeking of enlightenment and peace. 
Trahan whispers to Saffi "Is this what you were talking about?? Therapy" 
Saffi whispers back "Yes!" 
Tra'ahn turns around back to the monk, and asks for Debbie. The monk tells him they're in the guest bedroom, and that if they're here to retrive her and how did they make it to the island. 
Tra'ahn explains that they had arrived by ship, and that they were attacked by the bronze dragon and that rescuing Debbie was only one of the goals. 

The monk tells the party that Ronnom Dammos arrived about 6 months ago with some bodyguards Eko, Veen, and Moq escaping from the law as he was a wanted man. And the bronze dragon seems to be reluntact of him. 

Caelen asks if the dragon is only stopping people from coming in and out, but the monk doesn't know for sure. 
Alamira also ponders if the dragon doesn't care about the survivors if any, but only about sinking the ship. 

The mother of Ronnom Dammos was friend with the dragon, and the party speculates if maybe Ronnom Dammos is abusing this friendship to prevent those who would come seeking him from approaching the island. 

Tra'ahn asks about Ronnom's location and the monk tells him he's sequested to the bottom of the monastery, and that he only sends his bodyguards out for supplies. 

Tra'ahn asks about being able to talk to Debbie. But the monk also asks if the party can do something about Ronnom Dammos and his bodyguards. They're a peaceful people and are not equipped to deal with them. 

Alamira asks Tra'ahn if Bronze dragon are easily swayed or controlled. Tra'ahn says no, but they're still living creatures and are susceptible to persuasion or being controlled. 

Overall Ronnom Dammos is a bad person, and the monk wants him gone. 

Afterwards, the monk takes the party to the library. They see many bookshelves and glass stained windows. 
Saffi takes a few books about enlightenment and inner person to see if she can help her husband Echo and (something that could help with family therapy...). 

Afterwards the party starts exploring the temple a bit more, and saffi asks the monk when do the bodyguards come for supplies, which he responds is always in the morning. 

After this, he leads them to the guest bedroom where Debbie is, but doesn't tell which room she is in so the party starts awkwardly knocking on doors. 

The first door leads to an elf which seemed to be dressed more as a sailor, and she tells the party that debbie is next door. And that only 3 of the crew members survived. Upon remembering this, she sits on her bed and starts weeping. (both Alamira and Tra'ahn whisper to Saffi "Therapy!") But Saffi apologizes and slowly closes the door. 

After this, they make their way to debbie's room. 
"Yes?"- Debbie asks as she opens the door. 
Saffi tells her that they're here to rescue her. 
Debbie says that she can be ready at a moments notice. 
Saffi tells her that they can't return yet, but Debbie understands and explains that. the lodgings are surprisingly good and that they're willing to wait and be safe rather than rushing. 
tra'ahn asks her if she knows anything baout Ronnom Dammos. 
Debbie also tells the party that Treef, the third crew member that lived, that recognized him. Apaprently he was wanted for political asssasinations. That he's a noble man, and apparently was really brutal. 
Ishylia, is Ronnom's mother. 
Debbie offers them that they should talk to Treef for more information about him. 
Caelen asks about other survivors, but with a darkened face, Debbie tells him that if they did survive they haven't shown their face around the monastery And that the bronze dragon didn't leave much that may be survivable with how badly it destroyed the ship. 

From this, they make their way to Treef's room. A young human male. 
After introducing themselves, Treef Lamir claims that he didn't expect to run into a sparkscale. Taken aback Tra'han asks him if he's encountered a Sparkscale before. 
Treef claims no, but otherwise they clarify that the two families have made trades before and that's why he recognizes the family name. 

Treef claims he can't leave until Ronnom Dammos is dealt with and got his uncle killed and the ship sunk. 
Tra'ahn makes that Treef is young and head-strong and that he's angry. 
Treef tells him that Ronnom Dammos's mother was the one that built the wealth and had died a few years ago, and Ronnom Dammos has been squandering it ever since. 

Saffi asks treef if he's met and or talked to Ronnom Dammos. He claims that he saw him in the lower levels, but they kicked him out because nobody else was allowed to go down there. he thinks they know that Treef recognized him, and that they also killed all the birds in the Aviary to prevent them from flying away and alerting others and from sending messages. 

Caelen asks how well equipped they seemed to be. Treefs tells him that the bodyguard have no armor, and had relatively simple weapons. And only two come up at a single time, the two men. The woman stays behind and is relatively quiet. 
Alamira asks Treef if they know how Dammos' mother made friends with the dragon but treef doesn't know. 
Caelen asks about the wanted status of Ronnom Dammos. Treef tells him that he was wanted for political assassinations and that he's a noble man, and apparently was really brutal and was wanted for several murders. 
Treef tells them there's two staircases that lead down. 

At this the party decides to get an understanding of the temple, their surroundings and where the bodyguards come from. 
Alamira and Saffi decide to use invisibility on Whisper, her fox familiar, to scout the area downstairs. 
they reach out to the monk and ask him about the layout of the temple but they don't have any map as they've never needed one. 

So make their way to the Library, and uses her staff of invisibility on Whisper, and then channels her vision through her familiar and Caelen and Tra'ahn stay near the stairs where whisper is going down. 

Whisper then goes down the stairs, and immediately encounters two doors which unfortunately whisper as a fox cna't really open. 

So the party decides to go back to the other set of stairs to see if they can see more. 
Here Whisper sees at the bottom of the stairs and what seems to be a storeroom with crates and barrels. Fishing poles, spears, etc. It also spots 3 doors, and a hallway. It leads to two more doors. Whisper starts listening at the doors with no luck for the first two, upon reaching the third one at the end of the hallway and any of the other doors and hears nothing. They make their way back to the initial two doors at the beginning on the first set of stairs but still nothing. 

While this is happening, Saffi spots a book that seems largely what Alamira likes to read, and after Whisper retuns and Alamira relays her findings to them, Saffi determines to talk to the Hierarch (the main monk) about the layout of the temple and if there's any other information he can provide on the rooms behind the doors. (Alamira stays behind, rather excited about Saffi's finding.) 

Once having reached the hierarch, he explains that the first two doors in the first set of stairs are likely their room. 
While the others are for storage, a passage connecting to a hallway, and the other used to be dungeons that got converted to more guest rooms, and then there's an underwater passage way they don't go into. 

Given that the party is going to rest, Alamira determined to use Divination the question will be:
"If we take out/Neutralize/Kill Ronnom Dammos, how will the dragon Skalantir react?"
As Alamira focuses her magic through her Tarot Cards "Judgement" animated on its front as an angel is playing a trumpet, as fire takes the angel wings and burns them, as the card itself burns up and Alamira has to drop it as it burns to ashes. 

At this, the party wonders if  maybe they're misunderstanding the situation, and that maybe the dragon is actually a good dragon and that Ronnom Dammos is actually a good guy. 

Tra'ahn suggest interogating some people around first might be prudent so they find more information. 
The team ultimately decides to start with Debbie and ask her more questions. 

Alamira approaches Debbie and asks her why her journey led her on this voyage. She claims that it was for the spiritual safety of the ship. They weren't meant to stop here. But they came too close to the island. 

While Debbie didn't really seem off to Alamira, Alamira pushes her Detect Thoughts  to read her thoughts. 
She seems genuinely sad about all the deaths, and genuinely concerned about Ashlyn. 
However, at this Debbie is upset, and Alamira is unable to convince her that her actions were good. At this point Caelen steps in and covers for Alamira, and gives comfort to Debbie. 

After relaying what she learned from debbie, they decide she doesn't really have anything of importance. 
Given her nervousness, Tra'ahn suggest they take lead on the next conversation. 
As they aproach the hierarch, he's seen dismissing the other monks after their meditation. 
As Tra'ahn is talking to him, Alamira attempts to probe his thoughts with Detect Thoughts, but his thoughts are surprisingly calm and collected. 

Alamira Telepathically communicates with the party, asking them if they want her to continue. Because she's unsure's. Otherwise, the hierarch doesn't seem to have much more knowledge. 

Ultimately, the party decides to make their way to Treef. But Alamira thinks that she can consults the cards one more time, asks "If we turn Ronnom Dammos in at Baldur's Gate, will he meet justice?" 

As Alamira attempts to consult the cards her spell fizzles outs as she fails to get a response from the cards. 

At this, the party decides to rest, but before then, Saffi approaches Ashlyn rooms to talk to her and comfort her. And shares some of the books with her and tells her that she's willing to be a person she can talk to if she wants to. Ashlyn is grateful for the company and the books. But as she closes the door Echo says "Be Strong". 

In the meanwhile, Alamira asks the Hierarch if she can keep the spell book she found. After telling her the story of the Xamtarm, a spell caster dwarf who had died 20 years ago and had found enlightenment in the temple, the Hierarch agrees to let her keep the book. 

Early in the morning, Alamira asks the question they had in mind "Page of swords, Young woman running across, emperor flash by, authority, justice system that I'm delivering to, a figure holding a sword, and a scale, as it tethers back and forth, and the scale are at a perfect balance." Alamira makes sense of this as "Justice will be served, but it will be a long and arduous process." given that the dragon won't be happy. She relays this to the others in the morning when they wake up. 

They proceed to the kitchen area to wait for the guards coming up in the morning. 
Shortly after, Eko and Moq arrive, they look like twins almost, and they look like seafarers. As they enter the room, they look at the party with confusion. "you're not the usual people" 
Tra'ahn says " we have questions"
"About" they ask
"What are you and your master doing here?"
"That is not for us to know" Eko says 
"We're just here to do our job" Moq says
"What are you doing down below?" Tra'ahn says 
"He's just seeking shelther" 
"From justice at Baldur's Gate" 
"You know more than you should"
"We want to talk to him"
"Alright, follow us down and bring the supplies" 
Confused the party follows them down, and they make their way to the bottom of the temple as Tra'ahn 
The room that they're led to is rather dark, and it fits the criteria of the rooms they were told by he Hierarch. 
As they enter the main bedroom, Ronnom Dammos turns to look at the party coming in. 
The room is rather small, and there's no one else in the room. 
"Ohh, wasn't expecting travelers" Ronnom says 
"I imagine you weren't and it appears we have to deal with you"
"Am I just trash to be taken out?" Ronnom asks 
"That's yet to be seen" tra'han responds. 
They discuss how the dragon is destroying the ships and killing people. 
to which ronnom responds that he's then just doing his job. 
Tra'ahn explains who he is, and that he's not dealing with a commoner. 
Tra'ahn explains that he knows about him being wanted in Baldur's Gate for various crimes. 
Ronnom responds that he's aware, and overall he validates everything the party is saying. 
As he's being defensive, Tra'ahn queues Alamira, who was already prodding his thoughts, and Alamira pushes her Detect Thoughts to hear what Ronnom is thinking. 

She notices two things. 
1. The immediate situation, he's arrogant and calm despite the immediate intinimation because he has something in this room that keeps him safe. 
2. The questioning about Skalantis and the immediate reasoning that comes to mind/emotion that Alamira gets is concerned about the truth. 

Alamira telepathically communicates this to the party and specifically to Tra'ahn these findings. 
After his constant defensiveness, Alamira communicates once again with Tra'ahn and asks him if he wants her to push further. He nods to her, and at this point, she uses Suggestion to command him "Tell us the truth about what you don't want Skalantis to know." to which he blurts out "I don't want Skalantis to know that I am a murderer!", at which he covers his mouth, and then calls out from the darkest for Veen, who comes out of the shadow and invisible as a large red ogre.
