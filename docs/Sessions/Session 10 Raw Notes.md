# Chapter Ten: The Price of Cowardice

With the **Starglass Waypoint** behind them, the **Fellowship of the Dawnscale** returned to **The Nest**, their island estate now firmly anchored off the coast of **Cloakwood**. The tower, once a ruin, began to breathe with new life as the party assigned the rescued **Modrons**—**Uno**, **Dos**, **Tres**, and **Cuatro**—to specialized wings. **Alamira Ayreys** claimed the Arcane Studies, **Saffi Muddleblossom** cultivated a new Garden, and **Tra’Ahn Sparkscale** established a Barracks.

This period of growth and "stealth practice" (involving **Saffi** testing her **Ring of Jumping** on unsuspecting teammates) was interrupted by the arrival of **Arlen Wymond**, **Caelen**’s father. **Arlen** brought grim news: **Tra'Ahn**'s aunt, **Cleo**, was dead, lost during a hunt for a shadow-beast named **Ny’athor** in the **Shadowfell**.

Driven by duty, the party utilized a specialized scroll to pierce the veil between worlds. They stepped into the **Shadowfell**—a gray, leaching mirror of their own world where time and emotion seemed to leak away.

**[Vital Discovery]**
**Alamira** noted extreme time dilation within the plane; while only thirty minutes passed for the party, two weeks had vanished from the Material Plane.

Near a jagged canyon, they found a lone guardian standing watch over a burial mound.

**_Combat Starts_**

The **Stone Golem** was a relentless guardian. It unleashed a _Slow_ spell that paralyzed **Arlen** and **Tra’Ahn** before striking **Alamira** with a searing beam of arcane energy, knocking her unconscious. **Caelen Wymond** rushed to her side with a high-level heal, while **Saffi** utilized her new verticality to rain magically imbued arrows upon the construct. **Tra’Ahn** fought through the magical lethargy, delivering punishing blows with **Leafwarden**. **Alamira**, rising from the brink, delivered the final stroke—a _Lightning Chromatic Orb_ that shattered the golem into gray dust.

**_Combat Ends_**

In the mound, they recovered **Cleo**’s remains and her **Magical Armor**. However, **Alamira** grew suspicious of **Arlen**’s frantic behavior. Utilizing a charm spell, she drew out a staggering confession: **Arlen** had panicked and used binding magic on **Cleo**, sacrificing her as a distraction so he could escape the **Shadowfell**.

**[Vital Discovery]**
A _Speak with Dead_ ritual performed by **Caelen** confirmed the betrayal. The spirits of **Cleo**, the dwarf wizard **Sparkbeard**, and the rogue **Rymond** all revealed that **Cleo** died a hero, while **Arlen**’s last act was ensuring she could not follow him to safety.

The party returned to **The Nest**, stripping **Arlen** of his gear and placing him under heavy guard. As they attempted to rest, **Eggsmirelda** pulsed with a terrifying new vision: a ship engulfed in green lightning, a shadowed predator, and monks huddled in a sea-sprayed cave.
