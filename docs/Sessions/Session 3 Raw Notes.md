# Chapter Three: The Dragon's Ghost

The session begins as a disembodied voice echoes through the cavern, speaking a direct threat to the heroes as they stand before the skeletal remains of the long-dead dragon, **Death at Sunset**: “Bow down before your new master.”

We see **Armin** lying on the floor in front of the bones. **Tra’ahn** attempts to negotiate with the dragon spirit, who seems ready to attack. The dragon is proud and dismissive of **Tra’ahn**, whom it mistakes for a halfling. We notice what appears to be acidic breath emanating from near the center of the corpse.

**Alamira** attempts to push the fog away using magic (air from her hands), but this only seems to upset the dragon spirit further. **Caelen** and **Tra’ahn** approach **Armin** and realize with horror that his eyes have been melted by acid.

**_Combat Starts_**

An enraged smaller green dragon (the wormling Sunset-is-nigh) erupts from the bones. The dragon unleashes a poisonous gas at Caelen and Tra’ahn, hurting them gravely, though the prior antidote/inoculation helped reduce the damage.

As the dragon steps back into the fog, Saffi takes a difficult shot that lands on her target before stepping into cover. The dragon growls and calls for his minions. Alamira takes a chance with _Witch Bolt_; it misses the initial target but manages to connect the two nonetheless.

Tra’ahn moves forward over the bones to take a swing at the dragon, landing a slice. Caelen heals himself, steps away to avoid bunching up, and casts _Shield of Faith_ on Tra’ahn. The dragon attempts to slash at Tra’ahn with its claws, but he blocks the damage completely.

Safi comes out of cover and lands another shot. Alamira’s _Witch Bolt_ strikes the dragon as she follows up with _Ray of Frost_, both spells landing as the dragon growls in pain. Tra’ahn skillfully dodges an arrow and incoming spells while landing another strike. Finally, Caelen uses _Sacred Flame_, melting the dragon's flesh with radiant flame and killing it on the spot.

**_Combat Ends_**

Alamira hugs her spirit fox, Whisper, for comfort as she recovers from the panic. Saffi approaches Armin’s body, wondering what happened to his dog, Fletcher. Alamira looks around for a dog's body, but Saffi notes there are no tracks suggesting the dog ever entered the lair.

Tra’ahn and Caelen investigate further into the lair. Caelen curves around a corner and finds an area with bright, fluorescent mushrooms and the same type of insects encountered previously at the trees. While Tra’ahn and Alamira investigate a treasure pile behind the dragon's corpse, Saffi and Caelen are attacked by the bug swarm.

**_Combat Starts_**

Caelen attacks the first bug with a heavy blow. The bugs attempt to bite Saffi but fail. Saffi pulls her scimitars, hacking a centipede in half and slicing through the swarm. Hearing Saffi’s screams, Tra’ahn rushes in, killing most of the remaining bugs with his sword. Alamira casts _Ray of Frost_ but narrowly misses Tra’ahn. Caelen continues his attack, but some bugs remain. The swarm jumps at Saffi, hurting her slightly, but she retaliates with a Z-shaped slash, finishing them off.

**_Combat Ends_**

Saffi collects some of the mushrooms. As Caelen and Tra’ahn delve deeper into the last corner, they are attacked by bugs again.

**_Combat Starts_**

Saffi quickly disposes of the biggest centipede with a shot. Caelen uses _Sacred Flame_ to kill many of the smaller bugs. Tra’ahn and Alamira join in, with Alamira casting _Ray of Frost_. Saffi takes the final shot to clear the room.

**_Combat Ends_**

The team approaches the treasure pile and finds a magnificent sword sticking out of the gems. Saffi prepares _Detect Magic_. Meanwhile, Tra’ahn feels a warmth emanating from the dragon egg. As he brings the egg closer to the hoard, the warmth intensifies until the entire party falls unconscious.

In a shared dream, they feel they are being held by a friendly being but are also in great danger. They experience the same panic as the night the caravan was destroyed, but this time they feel like they are flying. They hear themselves yell, “But I can’t do this alone!” to which a dragon roars back, “You must!” before they suddenly fall and wake up.

They conclude they were feeling what the egg felt moments before they found it. The warmth fades. Saffi hugs the egg to comfort it, and it responds with a slight warmth.

Tra’ahn takes the sword and reads the Elvish inscriptions: “Leafwarden, slayer of dragons, protector of elves.” Saffi confirms it is a _Dragon Slayer_ enchanted longsword.

**Items Found in the Hoard:**

- 210 GP, 3,150 SP, 6,300 CP
- Twelve moonstones (50 GP each)
- Jade orb (100 GP) engraved in Infernal with the name "Stygia"
- Golden cup (50 GP)
- Hand mirror in a silver frame (40 GP)
- Ivory comb (35 GP)
- _Dust of Disappearance_
- _Keoghtom’s Ointment_
- _Potion of Giant Strength (Hill)_
- _Spell Scroll of Web_

**Alamira** communicates telepathically with **Whisper** to check the final area. They discuss the history of **Leafwarden**—a legendary blade used by a hero who fell fighting a green dragon. **Tra’ahn** practices a few swings with the new sword.

As they check the final corner, **Caelen** detects more creatures. **Tra’ahn** and **Caelen** take the lead. Moving roots previously spotted by **Whisper** begin to cackle and approach with hostility.

**_Combat Starts_**

**Alamira** immediately uses _Witch Bolt_ on the larger creature. **Tra’ahn** follows up with a slash, finishing it. **Echo**, who recently rejoined the fight, charges the last plant creature and kills it instantly.

**_Combat Ends_**

The room is empty of further interest. Returning to the dragon skeleton, **Tra’ahn** follows a trail of coins and realizes **Death at Sunset** must have pulled the sword out of its own body and left it in the hoard before dying. He also finds the remains of the egg **Sunset-is-nigh** hatched from. **Tra’ahn** moves the baby dragon's body out of the poisonous mist, planning to use its scales for armor later.

They find no sign of **Fletcher** in the cave. Outside, they inform **Caynen** of their success. He seems indifferent to anything but his tree, though he mentions seeing **Fletcher** heading toward town.

Returning to **Red Wood Watch**, the party is met with celebration. **Gwen** is devastated by **Armin**'s death. **Celenar** mentions **Fletcher** returned with four other villagers, suggesting the dog escorted them while **Armin** stayed behind. **Saffi** excitedly tells the villagers about the bugs and the "**Sunset-is-nigh**" encounter. **Tra’ahn** asks about a bard to record their deeds but finds none. **Alamira** learns that **Sunny Lightpurse** might have some information on other dragons.

After resting, they meet a mysterious elf named **Daetrius** who informs them they are the inheritors of **Eldemir’s estate**—as the owners of the egg. She gives them a one-time teleport to the estate and a one-time teleport _of_ the estate.

The party teleports to a 5,000-acre island estate featuring a weathered wizard's tower. While exploring, they find many out-of-date books, but the egg provides a vision of a brass dragon (likely the egg's mother) perched on the tower. **Saffi** speaks to the egg, which resonates with the feeling of "home."

During the journey back to the coast, they notice Echo now has gills and is moving like a seal. Tra’ahn investigates underwater and finds the island isn't attached to anything—it seems to be a piece of a mountain forcibly teleported into the sea.

As they row toward the coast, Saffi plays fetch with Echo using a plant-creature limb. She identifies their location near the Sword Mountains, between Waterdeep and the Mere of Dead Men. They decide to head to Waterdeep.

In Waterdeep, they rent a dock for 3 gold and stay at the "House of Good Spirits." Tra’ahn bargains for a 15% discount on horse transportation and buys a map for 1 gold. They encounter a halfling thief trying to sell a "magical candle" for 500 gold (dropping to 200). Saffi's _Detect Magic_ confirms it is transmutation magic. Caelen realizes the halfling's story about "Mummy Rot" is a lie. The thief attempts to flee, but Tra’ahn catches him, and Alamira uses _Phantasmal Force_ to halt him. City guards arrive, arrest the thief (who had a bounty), and return the candle to the merchant Lemir.

Finally, the party travels through Daggerford toward Hobbletown. As they approach, they see smoke rising and hear cries for help, realizing Tra’ahn’s vision of the burning town is happening right now.
