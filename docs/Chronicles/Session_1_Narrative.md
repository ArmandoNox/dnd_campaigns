# Chapter One: An Egg and an Oath

The storm did not brew; it erupted.

One moment, the caravan was trundling through the countryside, wheels groaning under the weight of trade goods and weary travelers. The next, the sky tore open. Rain lashed down like icy whips, and thunder shook the very marrow of the earth. But it was not the storm that froze the blood of the four strangers huddled in the lead wagon—it was what raged above it.

Two titans of scale and sinew locked in a dance of death. A flash of lightning illuminated their silhouettes—vast, winged shapes tearing at one another with primal fury. Then, a bolt of emerald energy shattered the sky, striking the caravan with the force of a falling star. Wood splintered, horses screamed, and the world dissolved into chaos.

**Tra’Ahn Sparkscale** was the first to rise from the mud, his dragonborn heritage lending him resilience against the blast. He hauled **Caelen Wymond** from the wreckage, the young cleric coughing up dust and rain. Nearby, **Saffi Muddleblossom** was already on her feet, checking her bowstrings with frantic precision, while the high elf **Alamira Ayreys** stared up at the roiling clouds, her scholar’s mind racing to categorize the destruction even as she trembled.

They sought refuge in a shallow cave, huddled against the biting wind. But they were not alone.

In the shadows lay a figure, broken and breathing their last. The stranger’s skin was pale, eyes dimming with the coming dusk of death. With a trembling hand, they reached out, pressing a heavy, warm object into Tra’Ahn’s scaled grip. It was an egg—smooth as polished brass and humming with a faint, rhythmic heat.

"The line of Cozmioko..." the stranger rasped, blood flecking their lips. "Trust... the egg."

Greatness is rarely asked for; it is thrust upon the unwilling in the dark corners of the world. As the stranger breathed their last, Tra’Ahn touched the surface of the egg. The world fell away.

_Green canopies stretching endlessly. Six colossal redwoods piercing the heavens. A village woven into their roots. A name, whispered on the wind: Red Wood Watch._

The vision shattered, leaving the fighter gasping. He looked to his companions—strangers hours ago, now bound by a dying wish and a dragon’s dream.

"We go to the trees," Tra’Ahn rumbled, his voice cutting through the storm.

The journey to **Red Wood Watch** was a quiet march, the storm giving way to an oppressive, sickly calm. The forest here was wrong. The air tasted of rot; the leaves hung limp and gray.

Upon arrival, they were met not with welcome, but with desperation. **Celanar** and **Gwenhomara Woodrise**, councilors of the village, looked upon the armed travelers with a mixture of fear and hope.

"You are mercenaries?" Celanar asked, his voice thin.

"Something like that," Saffi chirped, though her eyes were sharp, scanning the treeline.

The councilors spoke of a blight—a creeping necrotic rot that turned the forest’s guardians into monsters. Five villagers had vanished into the deep woods, including **Armin**, a fellow council member.

"We need a cure," Gwenhomara pleaded. "The six great trees... their bark holds the ancient magic of the elven families. If you can gather it, we can brew an inoculation. We can save them."

As night fell, the party gathered at the tavern of **Fergus**, a man who filled mugs with ale and ears with legends. He spoke of **Ethvarn**, a hero of old who fell battling the green dragon known as _Death at Sunset_. He spoke of **Leafwarden**, Ethvarn's blade, lost in the dragon’s lair.

Alamira’s eyes lit up at the mention of the sword, her quill scratching furiously in her journal. But Saffi was listening to something else—the wind outside. It carried rumors of walking trees with sharpened limbs and a green-skinned man who watched from the shadows.

The die was cast. They held a dragon’s heir in their pack and the fate of a village in their hands.

Welcome to the Delve.
