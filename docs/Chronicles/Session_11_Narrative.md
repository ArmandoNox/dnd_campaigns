# Chapter Eleven: The Dragon of Nashkir

The vision of the green lightning led them to **Baldur's Gate**.

**Caelen** had deduced the location—the **Nashkir Monastery** in the **Sea of Swords**. But before they could depart, loose ends with **Arlen** had to be tied. **Tra’Ahn** arranged for his clan to collect Arlen and **Cleo’s** remains, offering the fallen man a chance at redemption, or at least judgment. **Saffi**, ever the optimist, suggested family therapy, a concept Arlen seemed strangely open to.

With the heavy air of impending departure hanging over them, they rode to the city.

Finding a ship willing to sail into dragon-infested waters proved difficult. The docks were abuzz with fear—sailors spoke of a bronze dragon attacking ships near Nashkir. Hope appeared in the form of **Mirel Astafar**, a noble merchant found at **The Smiling Fish**. She introduced them to **Captain Orso**, a Tiefling who commanded the *Wavemont*.

They struck a deal: safe passage in exchange for rescuing **Debbie**, a survivor of a previous attack who was stranded at the monastery.

The journey was tense. **Alamira**, clinging to the solid deck and cursing her lack of swimming ability, was less than thrilled. **Tra’Ahn** warned the crew about bronze dragons—lightning breath, aquatic nature, and a territorial temper.

As the fog-shrouded island came into view, the warning became reality.

**Skalantir**, a massive bronze dragon, erupted from the waves.

**_Combat Starts_**

"Leave!" the dragon roared, its voice shaking the *Wavemont*. A gust of wind swept two crew members overboard.

**Tra’Ahn** held up **Eggsmirelda**, shouting in Draconic, "We bear the last heir of Kozmioko! We are not here to fight!"

The dragon hesitated, but the aggression didn't fade. Lightning crackled, striking the ship's center. **Alamira** was thrown overboard but misty-stepped back to safety, casting *Blade Ward*. **Caelen**, having cast *Water Walk*, sprinted across the waves to retrieve the fallen crew.

"Steer away or I will return!" Skalantir commanded.

**_Combat Ends_**

They had bought a moment. As the ship turned to fake a retreat, **Saffi** cast *Pass Without Trace*. The party slipped off the vessel, sprinting across the water’s surface under the cover of mist. They made landfall undetected.

The **Nashkir Monastery** was carved directly into the mountain, a place of peace and silence. They were welcomed by **Skalathas**, a young monk, and led to the **Hierarch**.

The monks were pacifists, ill-equipped to deal with their "guest"—**Ronnom Dammos**.

Dammos, a wanted noble and assassin, had sought sanctuary here six months ago. The monks believed the dragon, **Skalantir**, was friend to Dammos's mother and was now acting as his unwitting guardian, sinking ships to prevent anyone from reaching him.

The party investigated, speaking to the survivors. **Debbie** was safe but shaken. **Treef Lamir**, another survivor, burned with a desire for justice. He confirmed Dammos was hiding in the lower levels with his bodyguards, **Eko**, **Moq**, and **Veen**.

**Alamira** sent her familiar, **Whisper**, to scout. Invisible and silent, the fox explored the lower levels, finding guarded doors and a heavy atmosphere of secrets.

Consulting her tarot deck, Alamira asked, "Would bribing the dragon allow us safe passage?" The cards—Skull, Tower—gave a resounding, fiery "No."

A second reading was more hopeful: "If we turn Ronnom Dammos in at Baldur's Gate, will he meet justice?" The cards showed the Page of Swords and Justice balanced. It would be hard, but possible.

Morning brought action. They intercepted **Eko** and **Moq** as they came for supplies.

"We have questions," **Tra’Ahn** stated, his presence filling the room.

The bodyguards, realizing the gig was up, led them down.

**Ronnom Dammos** waited in a dark room, arrogant and unbothered. He admitted to his crimes with a smirk, confident in his safety. But **Alamira** was already in his mind.

*Detect Thoughts* revealed two things: his arrogance stemmed from a "safety" in the room, and he was terrified of **Skalantir** knowing the truth.

Seizing the moment, Alamira cast *Suggestion*. "Tell us the truth about what you don't want Skalantir to know."

Dammos’s composure shattered. "I don't want Skalantir to know that I am a murderer!" he blurted out.

Panic flared in his eyes. He covered his mouth, then screamed into the shadows.

"Veen!"

From the darkness, the air shimmered and shifted. **Veen**, no longer hiding, stepped forward—a massive, red-skinned **Ogre**.
