# Chapter Four: The Burning of Hobbletown

Smoke tasted of burnt sugar and charred flesh.

The party arrived at **Hobbletown** to find a nightmare. The quaint halfling village was ablaze. But this was no ordinary fire. The flames licked at buildings made of... candy?

"Illusion magic," **Alamira** surmised, waving a hand through a wall that looked like gingerbread but felt like hot stone. "Or transmutation gone horribly wrong."

They found the survivors huddled in the town square, surrounded by monstrous shapes. Constructs. Not of metal or stone, but of dough and icing, baked to hardness of iron. **Gingerbread Golems** lumbered through the streets, smashing homes with Gumdrop hammers.

"This is ridiculous," **Tra’Ahn** growled, shattering a cookie-man soldier with his pommel. "And terrifying."

At the center of the chaos stood a building untouched by the flames: **Uncle Nibblecheek’s Confectionary**. The sign swung creakily in the hot wind.

"He's in there," a sobbing villager pointed. "He invited us for a feast... and then the ovens... the ovens didn't stop."

**Saffi** moved to the window, peering through the frosted glass. Inside, it was a slaughterhouse of sweets. But in the back, she saw him—Uncle Nibblecheek, a portly halfling with a manic gleam in his eye, stirring a cauldron that smelled of chocolate and blood.

"We go in," **Caelen** said, hefting his mace. "Hard and fast."

They breached the door. The smell was overpowering—sickly sweet, cloying, suffocating. Nibblecheek turned, a wide, impossible grin splitting his face.

"Visitors!" he squealed. "Just in time for the glaze!"

The kitchen erupted into violence. Additional golems pulled themselves from the walls, doughy limbs grasping. **Leafwarden** sang in Alamira's hands, slicing through sugar-glass armor with ease. Tra’Ahn was a whirlwind of steel, holding the line against the horde.

But Nibblecheek was no mere baker. He snapped his fingers, and the floor beneath them turned to sticky molasses.

"Sticky, sticky!" the confectioner laughed, retreating towards a massive oven door. "Stay for dessert!"

"I hate sweets," Saffi spat, loosing an arrow that pinned Nibblecheek's chef hat to the wall.

He shrieked, tearing it free and diving into the oven—which was not an oven, but a portal. Swirling flames of purple and black.

"He's escaping!" Tra’Ahn roared.

Without a second thought, the party charged. Into the oven. Into the fire. into the unknown.
