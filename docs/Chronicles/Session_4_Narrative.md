# Chapter Four: The Burning of Hobbletown

The fire didn’t smell like woodsmoke. It smelled like burning sugar.

They rode into **Hobbletown** to find chaos. **Enid’s Sweet Shop** was an inferno. **Alamira** didn't hesitate, parting the flames with a wave of her hand to clear a path. **Tra’Ahn** kicked the door in, emerging moments later carrying an elderly halfling woman—**Enid**—while **Caelen** dived in for the truly important things: the cash register and a family photo.

**Saffi** organized a bucket brigade with **Echo** and the locals, dousing the structure before it could collapse. But the mystery remained: Enid didn’t use open flames.

"A half-eaten Cinnabon," Saffi noted, holding up a charred pastry found at the flashpoint. "Enid doesn't sell these."

A drunk woman rambled about "fire-breathing cows," which turned out to be less crazy than it sounded when the party found scorched grass leading into the woods. The trail ended at a structure that defied logic: a cottage made of gingerbread, icing, and malice.

**The Candy House.**

---

The welcome mat read _"Please, wipe your feet."_

**Alamira** sensed the conjuration magic too late. As **Saffi** tried to jump over it, the **Rug of Smothering** lashed out, wrapping the gnome in a suffocating embrace. Tra’Ahn didn't panic; he simply grabbed the animated textile, balled it up like dirty laundry, and threw it into the yard.

Inside was a funhouse of horrors. In the nursery, they found a cradle labeled **"Bubblewoga"** and a gray bag that felt like static. Alamira reached in, pulling out three balls of lint that popped into existence as a badger, a weasel, and a panther. "I shall call you... Fluff," she decided, petting the panther.

But the house had teeth. In the hallway, a pressure plate swung a comically large rolling pin down from the ceiling. **SPLAT.**

Caelen and Alamira were flattened into 2D cookie-cutout versions of themselves. They could still move, still fight, but they were... flat.

They pushed into the kitchen, where they found **The Baking Bears**—three massive beasts wearing aprons.

"Does Uncle know you're here?" one growled.

The fight was sticky. Tra’Ahn was shoved into a taffy-pulling machine, his scales stretching and coating in pink goo. He emerged changed—his flesh now possessing a rubbery, candy-like quality. Meanwhile, Alamira’s new panther mauled one bear, and Saffi’s arrows turned the others into pincushions.

Deeper they went. Past the courtyard of **Candy Dryads** (who only cared about their apples), and the **Chocolate Barn** filled with "Choco-trices."

"Chocolate-covered cockatrices," Caelen groaned, melting one with a radiant blast. "I'm never eating dessert again."

In the library, they found the truth: a book telling the story of Enid and her brother **Asgerd**, who traded his freedom to "Uncle" for unlimited candy.

Finally, they reached the inner sanctum. A massive wooden baby cyclops named **Bubblewoga** blocked the way.

"No entry," the wooden doll droned.

"Have a candy apple?" Tra’Ahn offered, holding out the treat they’d found earlier.

Bubblewoga snatched it. "Entry allowed."

They kicked open the final door. **"Uncle" Nibblecheek** stood by a cauldron, stirring a brew of chocolate and blood. Next to him, eyes dull and subservient, was a **Golden Dragon Wyrmling**.

"Just in time for the glaze!" Uncle shrieked, grinning a mouth full of rotten teeth.

The session ended as weapons were drawn and the smell of burning sugar grew overwhelming.
