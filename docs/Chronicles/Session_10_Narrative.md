# Chapter Ten: The Price of Cowardice

**The Nest** was finally becoming a home, rather than just a fortress.

With the arrival of the **Modrons**, efficiency had replaced chaos. **Uno** patrolled the battlements with **Tra’Ahn**, learning the art of defense. **Dos** buzzed happily around **Alamira** in the library, organizing scrolls with geometric precision. **Tres** shadowed **Caelen** in the infirmary, fascinated by the concept of "healing," while **Cuatro** helped **Saffi** coax life from the salt-sprayed garden.

It was a time of peace, punctuated only by Saffi’s new favorite game: "Death from Above." Testing her **Ring of Jumping**, the gnome had taken to launching herself from the tower parapets to land—mostly softly—on her unsuspecting companions during training. Even **Echo**, now scouting the coast as a snowy owl, wasn't safe from her aerial ambushes.

Then, a lone rider appeared on the causeway.

**Caelen** recognized the slumped posture before he recognized the face. "Father?"

**Arlen Wymond** fell from his horse, ragged and wild-eyed. He clutched Caelen’s tabard like a drowning man. "I tried," he gasped, tears cutting tracks through the grime on his face. "Cleo... she's gone, boy. Taken by the shadows."

He spun a tale of heroism and tragedy—a hunt for a shadow-beast named **Ny’athor**, a desperate battle, and a forced retreat when the darkness overwhelmed them. "I checked for a pulse," Arlen sobbed. "I swear it."

Tra’Ahn stood like a statue, his claws digging into the stone of the courtyard. "We go," he finished, his voice a low rumble of impending violence. "Now."

Using a scroll of _Plane Shift_ signed in blood, they tore a hole in reality.

The **Shadowfell** hit them like a physical weight. The color drained from their gear, leaving them in a world of monochrome greys. **Alamira**, checking her chronometer, cursed softy. "Time dilation. Every minute here is precious. We are already losing days back home."

They tracked the signs of battle to a jagged canyon. There, standing silent vigil over a fresh earthen mound, was a **Stone Golem**.

It did not roar. it simply activated.

"Intruders," it grated, the sound like tectonic plates grinding.

It raised a rune-carved fist, and the air grew heavy. A _Slow_ spell washed over them. **Tra’Ahn** and **Arlen** moved as if wading through molasses, their limbs heavy and useless.

The Golem turned its gaze to the casters. A beam of pure arcane force erupted from its eyes, striking **Alamira** square in the chest. She crumpled, unconscious before she hit the ash-gray ground.

"Alamira!" **Caelen** screamed. He rushed to her side, pouring the highest of his divine magic into her form, forcing breath back into her lungs.

**Saffi**, unaffected by the slow magic, triggered her ring. She vaulted high onto a jagged spire, raining magical arrows down on the construct’s joints. **Tra’Ahn**, fighting through the magical lethargy, threw himself between the Golem and the recovering wizard.

"Focus!" **Alamira** gasped, rising to her knees. She wove a spell of _Phantasmal Force_, conjuring an illusion of the Golem’s master. The construct faltered, confused.

That hesitation was its end. Tra’Ahn’s blade, **Leafwarden**, slammed into its knee, cracking the stone. Alamira followed with a _Chromatic Orb_ of lightning, shattering the guardian into a pile of harmless gravel.

They dug.

In the mound, laid out with surprising tenderness, were the remains of **Cleo Sparkscale**. She was fully armored, her hands folded over her chest.

"Why?" Tra'Ahn whispered, touching his aunt's cold face. "Why would a monster bury her with honors?"

Alamira turned to Arlen. The man was shaking, his eyes darting to the portal scroll.

"You're lying," she said, her voice laced with the power of a _Charm Person_ spell. "Tell us the truth, Arlen. Why are you alive?"

Arlen’s resistance broke. "I panicked!" he shrieked, backing away. "The beast... it was too fast. I used a binding scroll! On her! I stuck her to the ground so it would eat her instead of me! I had to! I'm sorry!"

The silence that followed was louder than the Golem’s fall.

"Caelen," Tra'Ahn said, not looking up from his aunt's body. "Ask her."

Caelen performed the _Speak with Dead_ ritual, his voice cracking. The spectral form of Cleo rose, her face weary.

"He... was hysterical," her spirit murmured. "I told him to run. But he bound me. His last act was ensuring I could not follow."

Beside her, two other spirits rose from the disturbed earth—**Sparkbeard**, a dwarf wizard, and **Rymond**, a rogue.

"I ordered the Golem to bury her," Sparkbeard’s ghost rumbled. "She fought like a demon to save us. She deserved honor."

"Arlen was always a coward," Rymond spat, glaring at the weeping man. "A tag-along. A rat."

They returned to **The Nest** in silence.

Thirty minutes in the Shadowfell had cost them two weeks in the material world. But the true cost was higher.

Arlen was stripped of his armor and thrown into the brig. Caelen couldn't even look at him.

That night, as the party tried to wash the gray from their souls, **Eggsmirelda** pulsed. A vision, chaotic and urgent, flooded their minds:

_Green lightning tearing through black sails. A storm at sea. Monks in orange robes huddling in a sea-cave, praying to a god who wasn't listening. And a massive, shadowed predator circling in the water._

The Fourth Hoard was calling. And unlike Arlen, they would not run.
