# Chapter Ten: The Price of Cowardice

**The Nest** was changing. The **Modrons**—christened Uno, Dos, Tres, and Cuatro—brought order to the chaos. Gardens bloomed under Cuatro’s care; the library was cataloged by Dos. For a moment, life was idyllic.

Then **Arlen Wymond** arrived.

He stumbled onto the beach, wild-eyed and ragged. **Caelen** ran to his father, hope warring with worry. But Arlen’s news shattered the peace.

"Cleo is dead," he gasped. "**Tra’Ahn**... your aunt... the Shadowfell... she fell."

Duty allows no time for grief. **Alamira** prepared the ritual. They would cross the veil. They would bring her home.

The **Shadowfell** was a world drained of color. The sky was a bruising purple, the ground ash-gray. And the cold—it wasn't a temperature, but a presence, sucking the warmth from their souls.

"Time moves differently here," Alamira warned, her breath misting. "We must be swift."

They found the burial mound near a jagged canyon. Standing watch was a **Stone Golem**, ancient and unyielding.

It moved with the inevitability of a landslide. A beam of gray light struck Alamira, and she fell, her life force flickering. **Caelen** screamed, channeling the full power of his faith to knit her spirit back to her body. **Tra’Ahn**, fueled by grief and rage, met the golem blow for blow. **Leafwarden** carved deep furrows in the stone, and **Saffi** rained death from above, leaping from cliff to cliff.

With a final crack of thunder, Alamira shattered the construct.

They entered the mound. There lay **Cleo Sparkscale**, majestic even in death. But as they gathered her armor, Alamira noticed something. The magical residue on the scene... it wasn't from a monster. It was binding magic.

"Arlen," Alamira said, her voice trembling with fury. "What did you do?"

Under the weight of a charm spell, the truth spilled out like bile. Arlen had panic. He had bound Cleo. He had fed her to the shadows to buy his own escape.

**Caelen** stared at his father, the man he had idolized, and saw only a stranger.

They returned to The Nest in silence. They stripped Arlen of his gear and threw him in the brig. A _Speak with Dead_ ritual confirmed the horror—Cleo had died fighting, betrayed by the one she sought to protect.

Tra’Ahn stood on the battlements, looking out at the dark sea. He had lost an aunt, and Caelen had lost a father.

But the world does not stop for broken hearts. Below decks, **Eggsmirelda** pulsed. A new vision filled their minds: a ship tossed on a stormy sea, green lightning arcing through the sails, and monks praying in a sea-cave.

The **Fourth Hoard** called. And they would answer.
