# Chapter Seven: The Crypt of the Arch-Lich

They were battered, bruised, and standing in a jail cell that smelled of centuries-old fear. But the **Abandoned Church** was not done with them.

In a dusty dining hall, they found the strangest horror yet: a man eating a sandwich. **Yondis** was alive, well-fed, and terrified.

"I identify as a zombie!" he stammered, holding up a crude mask. "Please, the benefits are amazing. Dental, housing... Zia takes care of us!"

Through Yondis, the hierarchy of the deep church was revealed. **Zia**, the serpent-tongued mistress of the cult. **Eleith**, the dwarf who guarded the knowledge. And **Melindra**, a ghost bound to the books she loved.

They let Yondis go—a small mercy in a dark place—and turned their eyes to **Eleith**.

They found the dwarf in the library, surrounded by tomes of forbidden lore. He fought with the desperation of a true believer, calling upon a god he thought dead. But when **Caelen** stepped forward, his holy symbol burning with the undeniable light of **Helm**, Eleith’s faith crumbled.

"She lied," the dwarf wept, dropping his axe. "She said the gods were gone."

Broken, Eleith led them to the heart of the corruption. To **Zia**.

The main chamber was a cavernous hall of shadows. Zia stood at the altar, a creature of impossible age and malice, surrounded by a legion of the dead.

"More bones for the pile," she hissed, her voice sounding like dry leaves skittering on stone.

Battle was joined. **Tra’Ahn** charged, a battering ram of scales and steel. **Saffi**’s arrows sought the necromancer’s heart, while **Alamira** wove counterspells to unravel Zia’s dark magic.

Then, the mountain shook.

"**ENOUGH!**"

The voice boomed from the shadows, deep and resonant. Zia froze. The zombies halted. From behind a statue of Orcus stepped... a small, silver dragon.

**Nezzerem**. He was no demon lord. He was a wyrmling, bored and brilliant, who had been using the cult’s "worship" to build his own hoard.

"I am bored of her," Nezzerem declared, pointing a claw at Zia. "Finish it."

With the dragon’s blessing (or perhaps just his indifference), the party surged. **Caelen** channeled the pure wrath of the morning sun, vaporizing the zombie guard. Tra’Ahn’s blade took Zia’s head, and the silence of the grave finally claimed the necromancer.

In the aftermath, Nezzerem regarded them with glittering, metallic eyes.

"You have rid me of a pest," the dragon mused. "And you carry an heir of my kin." He looked to the **Brass Egg**. "Place it in my hoard. Let it drink."

As the egg touched the gold, power rippled through the room—a wave of draconic essence that knocked them all to their knees. When they rose, the egg was warmer, heavier. It pulsed with the heartbeat of a third flight.

They had cleansed the church. They had found an ally in a silver dragon. But as they looked out over the snowy peaks of the Troll Mountains, they knew the world was only getting larger, and their enemies more ancient.
