# Chapter Five: The Confectioner's Kitchen

They tumbled out of the portal and onto cool stone. The heat of the oven was gone, replaced by the damp chill of a subterranean dungeon. But the smell remained—sugar and rot.

They were in the **Deep Larder**.

Here, Nibblecheek dropped the facade. He sniffed the air, his nose twitching violently. "I smell... **desire**," he hissed, pointing a sticky finger at **Tra’Ahn**. "And **secrets**," he whispered, turning his gaze to **Saffi**. "Such delicious ingredients."

The walls were not made of cake, but of rough-hewn granite. Cages lined the room, filled with horrors. In one, a creature made entirely of pink, stretching bubblegum clawed at the bars. **Alamira** gasped—it was **Asgerd**, Enid's brother, twisted into a mockery of life.

"You ruined the batch!" Nibblecheek screamed from a high gantry. He pulled a lever. "Spoiled ingredients must be discarded!"

Great vats of boiling chocolate began to tip.

"Save them!" **Tra’Ahn** ordered, throwing himself under the flow of one vat, his shield hissing as it deflected the scalding liquid.

**Saffi** and **Caelen** worked the locks, freeing the halflings and the bubblegum-Asgerd, while **Alamira** engaged the confectioner in a duel of spells. Nibblecheek hurled globs of acid-cream; Alamira countered with bolts of pure arcane force.

"You are nothing but a petty tyrant of treats!" she shouted, shattering the platform beneath him.

Nibblecheek fell, landing with a wet thud in a pile of flour. He scrambled back, looking at the angry heroes towering over him.

"Mercy!" he cried. "I only serve the Master! The Master of the Mountain!"

"What Master?" Tra’Ahn demanded, the tip of his blade hovering inches from the halfling's nose.

"The One in the Church!" Nibblecheek blubbered. "The Cult! They pay in gold and flesh! I just... I just feed the troops!"

They bound him. They saved the villagers. **Brioche Bane**, the golden dragon, shook its head as if waking from a long dream, its eyes clearing. It looked at Tra’Ahn with gratitude, not subservience.

But the victory felt hollow. Nibblecheek was but a symptom of a greater disease. A Cult. In the **Troll Mountains**.

"We have to go there," Caelen said quietly, wiping chocolate and grime from his armor. "If there is a cult taking people..."

"Then we end it," Saffi finished.

They emerged from the bakery into the cool night air of Hobbletown. The fires were dying down. The villagers were safe. But to the north, the silhouette of the Troll Mountains loomed against the stars like a jagged set of teeth.

And they were walking right into the bite.
