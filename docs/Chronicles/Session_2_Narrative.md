# Chapter Two: The Blighted Grove

The forest did not welcome them. It tolerated them, like a beast waiting for its meal to walk into its maw.

Having gathered the bark from the six great redwoods, the party ventured deeper into the corruption. The air grew thick with spores, and the silence was broken only by the snapping of dry twigs underfoot—or perhaps, the shifting of things that should not move.

**Saffi** led the way, her small frame slipping through the undergrowth. It was she who first spotted the anomaly: a goblin, dressed in scraps of bright red velvet, humming a tune that felt entirely out of place in this tomb of a forest.

"Name's Kringle!" the creature cackled, offering them a handful of suspicious berries. **Alamira** frowned, detecting faint transmutation magic, but **Tra’Ahn** merely snorted and pushed past. They had no time for riddles; the rot was spreading.

The trail led them to the **Redwood Grove**, a place that once might have been a cathedral of nature. Now, it was a festering wound. At its center stood a figure draped in moss and decay—the **Blight-Druid**.

"You seek to heal?" the Druid rasped, his voice the sound of grinding stones. Vines, black and pulsing with necrosis, writhed around his limbs. "Death is the only cure for this stagnation."

Combat was inevitable.

**Caelen** called upon his divine light, the radiance searing the shadows of the grove. The Druid roared, commanding the very trees to attack. Roots burst from the earth, seeking to crush the interlopers. Tra’Ahn met them head-on, his greatsword hacking through petrified wood, while Saffi loosed arrow after arrow into the Druid’s defenses.

It was a brutal, muddy melee. But as Alamira unleashed a weave of fire that forced the Druid back, they saw him—**Armin**, the missing councilman, bound to a corrupted altar.

"Focus on the Druid!" Tra’Ahn bellowed, taking a blow that would have felled a lesser warrior.

With a final, desperate surge, the party broke the Druid’s concentration. Saffi’s blade found its mark, and the creature dissolved into a pile of compost and rot. The oppressive weight on the grove lifted instantly, the black vines withering away.

They cut Armin down. He was weak, barely clinging to life, but his eyes held clarity.

"He... he was trying to wake it," Armin whispered, his gaze drifting to the earth beneath them. "Something sleeps beneath the roots."

They had the bark. They had the councilman. They had won the battle. But as they looked at the deep, dark earth of the grove, they couldn't shake the feeling that the war had only just begun.
