# Chapter Six: Blood in the Mountains

The air in the **Troll Mountains** was thin, sharp, and tasted of old iron.

The ascent had been brutal, but it was the silence that cut deepest. **Echo**, **Saffi**’s constant companion, lay bleeding on the scree, his flank torn open by something dead and hungry. As **Saffi** tended to him, she found something that made her blood run cold: decayed fingernails embedded in the wound.

As **Caelen** knelt to weave his healing magic, the wolf’s eyes opened. They were not the eyes of a beast, but of something... more.

"Saffi?" the wolf rasped, the word clumsy in a throat built for howling. "Cold?"

Saffi froze, her hand hovering over his fur. "He spoke," she whispered, looking to **Tra’Ahn**. "The magic here... it’s changing him."

"It changes everything," Tra’Ahn grumbled, eyeing the fog. "We move. Now."

They reached the **Abandoned Church** as twilight bled into night. It was a carcass of stone, green witch-light flickering in the windows. **Alamira** sent **Whisper**, her owl familiar, into the gloom. She saw them: figures in robes tearing down icons of **Lathander** and replacing them with bone mosaics of **Orcus**.

"Demon Lord of the Undead," **Caelen** spat.

They breached the doors. "Pull it down!" a robed dragonborn roared. "Make way for the Prince!"

**Tra’Ahn** answered with steel, crashing into the zombie line. **Saffi** and **Echo**—moving with terrifying synchronization—flanked the leader. The wolf’s jaws snapped the cultist’s staff, and Saffi’s blade finished the work.

But the church held more secrets. In a hidden alcove disguised by a **statue of a Vampire**, a skeleton wreathed in green fire exploded in a necrotic cataclysm. It nearly took Tra’Ahn’s head off, but **Saffi**’s covering fire kept the archers at bay while **Caelen** invoked the **Radiance of the Dawn**, turning the horde to ash. They recovered a **Wand of Magic Missiles** from the debris—a small prize for near death.

Deeper in the jail block, greed almost killed them. **Alamira** pulled a loose brick to reveal a **Wand of Secrets**, but unleashed a **Wraith**. The spirit drained Tra’Ahn’s strength until his scales turned gray.

"You have no power here!" Alamira screamed, hurling a sphere of chromatic ice through the ghost. It shrieked—a sound of tearing metal—and dissipated.

Silence returned. But it was heavy. They had taken the entrance, but the true darkness lay in the crypts beneath their feet.
