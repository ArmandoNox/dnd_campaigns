# Chapter Nine: The Astral Gate

The **Starglass Waypoint** was a labyrinth of light and metal.

Ascending to the second level, the party found themselves in a hanging garden—alien flora tended by automation. But nature here was hostile. Vines thick as pythons erupted from the planters, seizing **Caelen** and dragging him toward a toothy maw.

"Fire!" **Saffi** screamed, leaping from a catwalk. She defied gravity, her **Ring of Jumping** propelling her in impossible arcs.

The battle was vertical and chaotic. **Alamira** misted through the air, appearing behind the plant-beast to severe its roots with arcane fire, while **Tra’Ahn** hacked Caelen free from the crushing embrace.

Catching their breath, they moved to the control center. A **Githyanki** warrior stood there, smashing consoles with grim efficiency.

"This outpost is compromised," she sneered, looking at the weary party. "The dragon is broken. Do not interfere." With a flash of silver light, she vanished, leaving them alone with the monster.

They found the "thief" in the luxury suites—a winged kobold named **Bobson**, living like a king in a tent of silk.

"I didn't steal nothing!" Bobson squawked, clutching a bag. "Just a dagger! A little dagger!"

They traded for his ring, but the truth was far sinister. The dragon believed his hoard was disappearing. And he was right.

They found **Ylaglan** at the **Astral Gate**, a swirling vortex of starlight. The Brass Dragon was a wreck—scales dull, eyes darting at shadows, claws tearing at the metal floor.

"Who took it?" Ylaglan roared, steam hissing from his vents. "My gold! My life! Give it back!"

Reason had fled. Combat was the only answer.

Ylaglan’s breath was a cloud of sleep gas that dropped **Caelen** and **Saffi** instantly. **Tra’Ahn** fought through the drowsiness, his will as iron as his blade. **Leafwarden** flared with green light, sensing its ancient enemy's kin. **Alamira** stood her ground, a beacon of arcane focus, launching bolts of lightning that cracked the dragon's scales.

With a final, thunderous shield bash, Tra’Ahn knocked the great beast unconscious.

Silence fell over the gate. They searched the hoard, or what was left of it. And there, sitting innocently atop a pile of coins, was a bag. A bag with teeth.

"A **Bag of Devouring**," Alamira realized, horror dawning. "Everything he put in... it ate."

They had saved the dragon from himself. Ylaglan, waking with a headache and a heavy heart, allowed them to infuse the **Egg**. He gave them the **Orb of Control Elementals** and a portal home.

They returned to **The Nest** not just as heroes, but as landlords. A tribe of **Modrons**, grateful for their salvation, marched behind them. The tower would never be quiet again.
