# Chapter Nine: The Astral Gate

The **Starglass Waypoint** was a labyrinth of light and metal.

Ascending to the second level, the party found themselves in a hanging garden—alien flora tended by automation. But nature here was hostile. Vines thick as pythons erupted from the planters, seizing **Caelen**.

"Fire!" **Saffi** screamed, leaping from a catwalk. Her **Ring of Jumping** propelled her in impossible arcs. **Alamira** misted through the air, appearing behind the plant-beast to severe its roots, while **Tra’Ahn** hacked Caelen free.

Catching their breath, they moved to the control center. A **Githyanki** warrior stood there, smashing consoles.

"This outpost is compromised," she sneered. "The dragon is broken. Do not interfere." She vanished in a flash of silver light.

They found the "thief" in the luxury suites—a winged kobold named **Bobson**, living like a king in a silk tent.

"I didn't steal nothing!" Bobson squawked. "Just a dagger!"

They traded for his ring, but as they left the bazaar, the ground shook. An **Earth Elemental**, summoned by the chaotic magic of the place, erupted from the floor.

**Tra’Ahn** brutally slammed his shield into the creature, cracking its rocky hide. **Alamira** cast _Phantasmal Force_, trapping the elemental’s mind in a maze of illusions, while **Saffi** drilled arrows into its fissures until it crumbled into a pile of harmless rubble.

Finally, they reached the **Astral Gate**. **Ylaglan** the Brass Dragon was a wreck—scales dull, eyes manic.

"Who took it?" he roared. "My gold! My life!"

Ylaglan’s breath was a cloud of sleep gas that dropped **Caelen** and **Saffi** instantly. **Tra’Ahn** fought through the drowsiness, **Leafwarden** flaring with green light. **Alamira** launched bolts of lightning that cracked the dragon's scales.

With a final, thunderous shield bash, Tra’Ahn knocked the great beast unconscious.

Silence fell. They searched the hoard. And there, sitting innocently atop a pile of coins, was a bag. A bag with teeth.

"A **Bag of Devouring**," Alamira realized. "Everything he put in... it ate."

They had saved the dragon from himself. Ylaglan, waking with a headache, allowed them to infuse the **Egg**. He gave them the **Orb of Control Elementals** and a portal home, where a tribe of **Modrons** marched behind them, ready to serve **The Nest**.
