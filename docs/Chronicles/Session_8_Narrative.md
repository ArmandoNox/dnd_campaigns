# Chapter Eight: Nine Hoards Remain

Home. It is a strange word for adventurers.

They christened the tower **"The Nest."** Before settling in, they returned to **Greysmere** to celebrate. In a fit of generosity that shocked the table, **Tra’Ahn** slammed a massive, 750-gold-piece statue onto the bar. "For the decor," he rumbled to a stunned **Orion Solaris**.

Back at the tower, the past knocked on the door. **Thalamil**, a high elf of arrogant bearing, arrived seeking **Alamira**. He brought news from her father—a test of her worthiness. Expectations of Candlekeep cast long shadows.

But the future would not wait. On the fourth night, the **Egg** screamed.

A vision: _A metallic canyon. A city of glass and gears. A dragon tearing it apart._ It ended with the flash of their own basement teleportation circle.

"We go," Tra’Ahn said.

They stepped into the circle and vanished.

Heat struck them like a physical blow. They stood in the ruins of a tower under the burning azure sky of **Calimshan**. Spanning the canyon before them was the **Starglass Waypoint**—a bridge to the stars made of metal and crystal.

"Help!" A voice echoed in their minds. "I am trapped!" It was **Keliphond**, a disembodied guide.

At a pristine fountain, the water rose up. A **Water Elemental** slammed into **Saffi**, forcing the air from her lungs. The fight was desperate, fought on slick tiles. **Alamira** froze the beast with _Ray of Frost_, shattering it into harmless ice cubes.

Deeper they went, into halls of alien geometry. There, they found crates stacked in the shadows.

"Careful," **Caelen** warned.

Too late. One of the crates sprouted teeth. A **Mimic**!

As they fought the abomination, **Modrons**—geometric beings of law—scuttled out from hiding. Mistaking the party for thieves, they attacked with mathematical precision. **Tra’Ahn** defended himself, but his heart broke as the creatures disintegrated into dust upon defeat.

"They are just scared," he mourned.

Using magic to bridge the language gap, they parleyed with the survivors. They learned of **Ylaglan**, a Brass Dragon driven to paranoid frenzy.

"He is in the Astral Gate," a spherical Modron beeped, handing them a glass keycard. "Please. Reset the unit."

They looked up at the upper levels. Somewhere up there, a dragon was losing its mind.
