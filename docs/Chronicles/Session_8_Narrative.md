# Chapter Eight: Nine Hoards Remain

Home. It is a strange word for adventurers.

They christened the tower **"The Nest."** It stood defiantly on the coast of **Cloakwood**, a spire of stone now guarded by the heroes who had claimed it. For a few days, there was peace. **Tra’Ahn** trained. **Saffi** tended the grounds. **Caelen** prayed.

Then the past knocked on the door.

**Thalamil**, a high elf of arrogant bearing, arrived seeking **Alamira**. He brought news from her father—a test of her worthiness. It was a stark reminder that even thousands of miles away, the expectations of Candlekeep and kin cast long shadows.

But the future would not wait for the past to settle. On the fourth night, the **Egg** screamed.

It wasn't a sound, but a vision shared by all. A metallic canyon. A city of glass and gears. And a dragon, dark and terrible, tearing it apart. The vision ended with a flash—the sigil of their own basement teleportation circle.

"We go," Tra’Ahn said, buckling his armor.

They stepped into the circle and vanished.

Heat struck them like a physical blow. They stood in the ruins of a tower, but the sky was the burning azure of **Calimshan**. Before them stretched a canyon, spanned by a miracle of architecture: the **Starglass Waypoint**. It was metal and crystal, suspended over the void like a bridge to the stars.

"This is not of this world," Alamira whispered, touching a wall that hummed with vibration.

"Help!" A voice echoed in their minds. "I am trapped! The dragon comes!"

It was **Keliphond**—a voice without a body, guiding them forward. But the Waypoint was not empty.

At a pristine fountain, the water rose up, forming a crushing wave of malice. A **Water Elemental** slammed into **Saffi**, forcing the air from her lungs. The fight was desperate, fought on slick tiles under a blinding sun. **Alamira** slowed the beast with frost, freezing its fluid form until Saffi could shatter it with a well-placed arrow.

Deeper they went, into halls of alien geometry. There, they found the victims of the dragon's rage: **Modrons**.

They looked like geometric toys—cubes and spheres with spindly limbs. They huddled in the shadows, terrified. When **Tra’Ahn** approached, they shrieked in binary panic.

"Meat-things! Destroyers!"

The skirmish was tragic. The Modrons, driven mad by fear, attacked with mathematical precision. Tra’Ahn defended himself, but his heart broke as the creatures disintegrated into dust upon defeat.

"They are just scared," he mourned, lowering his blade.

Using magic to bridge the language gap, they parleyed with the survivors. They learned of **Ylaglan**, a Brass Dragon who had once been a protector, now driven to a paranoid frenzy. He was tearing the station apart, looking for a thief that didn't exist.

"He is in the Astral Gate," a spherical Modron beeped, handing them a glass keycard. "Please. Reset the unit. Restore the logic."

They looked up at the upper levels of the Waypoint, gleaming in the desert sun. Somewhere up there, a dragon was losing its mind, and they were the only ones who could bring it back from the brink.
