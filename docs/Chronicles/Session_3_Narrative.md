# Chapter Three: The Dragon's Ghost

The gathered mist spoke with a voice like grinding stones. **"Bow down before your new master."**

**Armin**, the ranger they had come to save, lay on the floor, his eyes burned away by acid. **Tra’Ahn** stepped forward, his small stature betrayed by his immense courage, attempting to parley. But the ghost of **Death at Sunset**—a spectral green dragon born of smoke and malice—knew no negotiation, only pride.

"Flesh for the rot," it hissed, unleashing a breath of poisonous fog.

**Caelen** and Tra’Ahn took the brunt of it, their skin blistering, but the antidotes they had consumed earlier held the worst of the toxin at bay. **Saffi** was a blur of motion, diving behind rock formations and loosing arrows that flew true despite the obscuring mist. **Alamira** wove a tether of lightning—a _Witch Bolt_—that connected her to the beast, a crackling leash of arcane power.

The combat was a chaotic dance. Tra’Ahn blocked claws with his shield, Caelen called down the searing light of _Sacred Flame_, and Saffi, cornered by the dragon's minions—a swarm of acidic centipedes—unleashed a Z-shaped slash with her scimitars that left them in ruin.

In the end, it was the light that killed the shadow. Caelen’s _Sacred Flame_ melted the spectral flesh, and the ghost dissolved with a final, furious shriek.

Silence returned to the cave. And there, thrust into a pile of gold, was the sword.

**Tra’Ahn** pulled it free. The inscription in Elvish hummed with ancient power: _"Leafwarden, slayer of dragons, protector of elves."_

They looted the hoard—moonstones, a jade orb etched with the word "Stygia," and potions of strength—but the true prize was the **Brass Dragon Egg**. As Tra’Ahn held it, he felt a sudden, overwhelming warmth. A vision flooded them: _flight, fear, and a voice roaring "You Must!"_

They left the cave, carrying Armin and the body of the wyrmling "Sunset Is Nigh" (Tra'Ahn had ideas for armor styling), and returned to **Redwood Watch**.

The victory was short-lived. A new player entered the board.

**Daetrius**, an elven solicitor with eyes like flint, approached them in town. She unrolled a scroll that rewrote their destiny. **Eldemir’s Estate**—a wizard’s tower on a wandering island—now belonged to them.

One teleportation later, they stood on their new home: 5,000 acres of forest, beach, and a ruined tower, floating somewhere in the trackless ocean.

"It moves?" Alamira asked, disappointed she couldn't find a giant turtle underneath it.

"It moves," Tra'Ahn confirmed, after an underwater expedition with **Echo** (who had sprouted gills and was swimming like a seal). "The rocks underneath don't belong to the sea floor."

That night, as Tra’Ahn woke Alamira for her watch, a vision struck them both. _Fire. Screams. The smell of burning sugar._

**Hobbletown** was burning.

They rowed. They didn't have the magic to teleport back, so they took their small boat and rowed until their arms burned, following the coast to **Waterdeep**.

The great city was a blur of commerce. They rented a dock (haggling the price down, naturally), bought horses, and ran afoul of a desperate halfling trying to sell a "Mummy Rot" candle for 500 gold.

"My mother was a mummy!" the thief cried.

"Mummy rot isn't real," Caelen sighed, taking the candle. It was magical, but stolen. After a brief chase involving _Phantasmal Force_ and a tackle by Tra’Ahn, they returned the item to its owner, **Lemir**, and collected a bounty.

But there was no time to celebrate. The vision pressed on their minds. They rode south, pushing their mounts to the breaking point.

As they crested the final hill, they saw it. Not a memory. Not a dream.

**Hobbletown** was on fire. And the smoke smelled like... caramel?
