# Chapter Three: The Dragon's Ghost

Victory is a fleeting comfort. No sooner had they returned Armin to the safety of Red Wood Watch than the call of the past lured them back into the dark.

**Alamira** could feel the pull of it—the arcane resonance of **Leafwarden**. Legends said the blade lay in the lair of the green dragon **Death at Sunset**, a creature slain centuries ago. But legends often leave out the parts that bleed.

The lair was hidden behind a cascading waterfall, the spray masking the stench of sulfur and decay. As the party stepped into the cavern, the air grew cold—unnaturally so.

"Do not disturb the slumber of the great," **Caelen** whispered, his holy symbol glowing faintly.

Too late.

Mist coalesced in the center of the hoard chamber, twisting and forming into a serpentine shape. Green spectral fire ignited in empty eye sockets. The ghost of Death at Sunset had not left its hoard unguarded.

**"THIEVES,"** the spirit hissed, the sound echoing in their minds rather than their ears. **"FLESH FOR THE ROT."**

The battle was one of mind as much as muscle. The dragon's breath was not toxic gas, but vivid hallucinations of terror. **Tra’Ahn** saw his clan burning; **Saffi** saw the forest turned to ash. But it was Alamira, standing before the prize she had sought for so long, who broke the spell.

"You are dead!" she cried, arcane power surging through her staff. "Be silent!"

She unleashed a torrent of force that disrupted the ghost's form, giving Tra’Ahn the opening he needed. With a roar that rivaled the dragon's own, he plunged his blade into the spectral heart. The ghost shrieked, a sound of tearing metal, and vanished into the ether.

Silence returned to the cave. And there, resting atop a mound of gold coins, was the sword.

**Leafwarden**. Its blade was etched with leaf patterns that seemed to shift in the light. It hummed when Alamira touched it, a song of protection and sharp edges.

But as they gathered the loot—gold, gems, and ancient trinkets—**Echo**, Saffi's strange companion, chittered a warning. They looked to the cave entrance. High in the distance, smoke was rising. Thick, black smoke.

It was coming from the direction of **Hobbletown**.

"No rest for the wicked," Saffi muttered, checking her quiver. "Or the righteous, it seems."

They left the cave rich in gold but heavy in spirit. The fire on the horizon burned bright against the setting sun.
