# Session 5: The Baker's Dragon and the Silver Smile

## Overview

The confrontation in the **Candy House** kitchen unraveled not with a death, but a deal. The "villain" **Brioche Bane** was revealed to be an innocent pawn, misled by a protective father. With the curse lifted and their forms restored, the Fellowship summoned their otherworldly estate to the **Cloakwood Coast**. But rest was fleeting; a new vision drew them to the mountains of **Greysmere**, where a smiling Aasimar and a resurfacing cult of undeath awaited.

## The Chronicle

### The Deal with the Devil (Maker)

The standoff with **Uncle Nibblecheek** was a clash of steel, spells, and dental hygiene. The Fae creature, intrigued by the party's cookie forms, attempted to strike a deal for their permanent surrender of "desires" or "faith." **Tra’Ahn** and **Caelen** refused, and combat ensued.

**Saffi**’s arrows and **Tra’Ahn**’s blade cut deep, while **Caelen** (despite being knocked prone by fire breath) rallied the team. Uncle, realizing he was outmatched—and perhaps valuing his own skin over Enid's pact—sued for peace. He offered a trade: their freedom and human forms restored, in exchange for an end to hostilities.

The party agreed. Uncle reverted their transformations and released the golden dragon wyrmling, **Brioche Bane**, from his influence. He revealed that **Asgerd** (Enid's brother) was part of a separate deal, one the party chose not to interfere with, respecting the grim laws of the Fae.

### The Baker's Secret

Outside, the party learned the tragic comedy of the Hobbletown fire. **Brioche Bane** had burned the shop because her "Papa," the dwarf baker **Fill**, had complained that **Enid** was a "bad person" for stealing his business.

Confronting Fill at his bakery, the truth came out. Fill was a former bandit who, in a botched raid that killed a dragon, had stolen an egg. He raised the hatchling, Brioche, as his own daughter. He never meant for her to commit arson; it was a child's misguided attempt to help her father.

Seeing the dragon was merely a child, the party forgave them. **Tra’Ahn**, ever the dragon-kin, offered a truce and even used gold to bribe the young dragon into letting them place the **Brass Dragon Egg** on her hoard (her bed).

### The Summoning

The contact with the hoard triggered another vision, this time solidifying their connection to the inheritance. Leaving Hobbletown (and a terrified ginger-gnome Enid, seemingly caught by Uncle), the party contacted **Daetrius** via the business card.

They chose a new location for the **Estate of Eldemir**: the **Cloakwood Coast**, near the Cimarine Isles. With a thunderous boom, the island teleported into the material plane, anchoring itself to the coast.

### To Greysmere

Safe in their tower, a new dream came to them. A vision of a smiling man with silver hair standing behind a bar in **Greysmere**, a town in the **Troll Mountains**.

Recognizing the town as a settlement of retired heroes, the Fellowship traveled south. They arrived at the **Death’s Bane Tavern**, where they met the man from the vision: **Orion Solaris**, an **Aasimar** tavern keeper.

Orion was expecting them (sort of—he had sent a messenger named Marty, who apparently missed them entirely). He drafted them into a new quest: the **Cult of Orcus** had resurfaced. They were stealing mundane supplies—ladders, rope, paint, and wheelbarrows—and digging up corpses.

### The Stakeout

The party laid a trap. **Tra’Ahn** and **Alamira** took watch, while **Saffi** and **Caelen** investigated a nearby house. They found **Mog**, an Orc who reported stolen candles and gaming sets.

A zombie was spotted dragging a sack toward the abandoned church in the mountains. **Saffi** sent **Echo** to follow. When the party finally tracked them, the trail ended in blood.

They found **Echo** barely alive, beaten by the quarry. **Caelen**’s healing magic saved the faithful companion. As Echo gasped for air, he spoke three words that shook the party to their core, revealing an awakening intelligence:

_"Is Saffi Okay?"_
