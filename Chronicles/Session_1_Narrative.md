# Session 1: An Egg, an Oath, and a Blighted Wood

## Overview

Fate—or perhaps the turbulent whims of the weather—brought four strangers together in a caravan that would not survive the night. **Saffi Muddleblossom**, **Alamira Ayreys**, **Tra’Ahn Sparkscale**, and **Caelen Wymond** found themselves forged into a fellowship by a storm of dragons and a dying wish. Tasked with protecting the last **Brass Dragon Egg** of **Cozmioko**, their path has led them to the blighted village of **Red Wood Watch**, where ancient trees rot and legends of the dragon **Death at Sunset** stir once more.

## The Chronicle

### The Storm and the Stranger

The journey began simply enough, a caravan winding its way through the countryside. But the sky, bruising purple and black, promised violence. That promise was kept when two colossal shapes broke the cloud layer—**dragons**, locked in a titanic duel that shook the heavens. Darkness and rain obscured their colors, but their fury was unmistakable. A stray bolt of lightning shattered the caravan, scattering horses and wagons like toys.

Seeking refuge, the four travelers scrambled into a nearby cave, leaving the ruins of their transport behind. They were not alone in the dark. A **Female Human**, likely a wizard by her robes, lay broken and dying in the shadows. With her final breaths, she thrust a heavy, warm object into their hands: a **Brass Dragon Egg**.

"Trust the egg to guide you," she rasped, her life fading with the storm outside. She spoke of it being the last line of **Cozmioko**, a burden now passed to four unsuspecting heroes.

**Caelen Wymond** knelt beside her, whispering prayers to the Morninglord as he performed the rites of burial, returning her body to the stone she had died upon. **Tra’Ahn Sparkscale**, drawn by an inexplicable pull, laid a clawed hand upon the egg.

### The Vision of Red Wood

Contact with the egg triggered a violent, vivid vision in the Dragonborn’s mind. He saw a grove of six immense **Redwood Trees**, a village nestled in their shade, and a dragon skeleton so massive it formed a landscape of its own. The name whispered in his mind was clear: **Red Wood Watch**.

The storm eventually broke, leaving the fellowship with a destination and a divine mandate. The journey to the forest was eerily calm. **Saffi Muddleblossom** guided them through the greens, her ranger's eye noting the deepening sickness of the woods. **Alamira Ayreys**, mind already racing with connections, spoke of the legendary sword **Leafwarden**, said to be lost in this very region, once wielded by the hero **Ethvarn**.

### The Blight of Red Wood Watch

Upon arriving at the village of huge trees, the party was immediately intercepted by **Celanar Woodrise** and **Gwenhomara Woodrise**, two-thirds of the Village Council. Desperation lined their faces; they mistook the heroes for mercenaries, a mistake they were all too happy to accept if it meant aid.

The village is dying. A magical blight is poisoning the six ancestral Redwoods. Worse, villagers are vanishing—first Councilman **Armin**, and then the search party sent after him.

The Council proposed a cure: a brew made from the bark of all six Great Trees. It is a desperate hope, but the only one they have.

### Rumors at the Inn

Before setting out, the party rested at the local inn run by **Fergus**. Over ales and hushed whispers, they gathered intelligence that painted a grim picture:

- **Death at Sunset**, the green dragon slain by Ethvarn, may not be as gone as history suggests. Her lair is rumored to hold the sword **Leafwarden**.
- Strange sightings plague the woods: a man with green skin and hair of leaves, and "walking trees" with sharpened limbs—likely corrupted **Dryads**.

With the **Brass Dragon Egg** hidden and their resolve steeled, the **Fellowship** prepares to step into the blighted grove. The storm has passed, but the darkness is just beginning.
