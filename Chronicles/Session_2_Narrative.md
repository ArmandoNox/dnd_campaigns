# Session 2: The Blighted Grove and the Serpent's Nest

## Overview

The storm may have passed, but the corruption of **Red Wood Watch** runs deep. Venturing into the **Redwood Grove**, the Fellowship faced the undead victims of the blight and the twisted guardians of nature. They uncovered a bitter betrayal by Councilman **Armin**, forced into servitude to save the village, and descended into the toxicity of the **Lair of Death at Sunset**. There, they rescued the lost and struck down the serpent **Marilisaa**, only to find themselves standing before a dragon's grave, with a voice from the dead promising their doom.

## The Chronicle

### Into the Rot

With the storm clouds clearing, the party stepped into the **Redwood Grove**. What should have been a sanctuary of life was a hexagonal tomb. A poisoned stream bubbled with foul energy, cutting through the clearing where five of the six Great Trees stood sentinel.

The corruption wasted no time in greeting them. As **Caelen** investigated strange insects boring into the ancient bark, the mud shifted. The discolored, preserved corpses of fallen travelers—victims of the grove's poison—twitched and rose. Tracks in the mud revealed a disturbing detail: the boot prints of a hunter and the paws of a large wolf, watching and waiting.

The battle was joined. **Tra’Ahn** met the undead charge with shield and steel, while **Alamira**’s frost magic slowed their advance. **Saffi**’s arrows found their marks alongside **Caelen**’s holy fire, returning the travelers to a true rest. But the rot had more to offer; a swarm of giant, venomous centipedes erupted from the earth. Lightning breath, magic missiles, and twin blades made short work of the vermin, but the message was clear: the land itself was their enemy.

### The Guardian and the Betrayal

Across the sludge-filled stream, the party encountered **Caynen**, a Dryad guardian of the fifth tree. Unlike the hostile flora they had heard of, Caynen was lucid, though desperate. He revealed the true source of the blight: it bled from the **Lair of Death at Sunset**, where a "wormling" had taken roost. He granted them the bark they needed but warned them of the perils ahead.

After a messy skirmish with exploding mud mephits at the final tree, **Alamira**’s curiosity drew the group towards the Lair’s entrance. There, the tracks they had seen earlier found their owner.

They found **Armin**, the missing councilman, and his wolf **Fletcher**. It was not a hopeful rescue. Armin stood as a guard, weapon drawn. A tense standoff ensued, weapons ready, until Alamira’s plea for reason broke the silence. Armin confessed, his spirit broken: he was being blackmailed. The "wormling" threatened to unleash pestilence upon the entire village if he did not guard the nest. He had watched the other villagers enter, unable to stop them, forced to abandon them to their fate.

Realizing they were ill-equipped for the lair's concentrated toxins, the party made the difficult choice to retreat and prepare.

### The Serpent's Nest

The Fellowship returned to Red Wood Watch, securing specific **inoculation potions** brewed by **Sunny** to ward off the lair’s blight. Fortified and resolved, they returned to the cave.

Bypassing Armin, they delved deep into the fumes. They found the four missing villagers, alive but terrified, discovering that Armin had known of their plight but was powerless to act. Sending them to safety, the party pushed on to a side chamber where the "wormling's" lieutenant waited.

**Marilisaa**, a serpentine monstrosity of unknown origin, attacked with a giant snake at her side. The battle was vicious. **Alamira** was nearly felled by the creature's speed, but **Tra’Ahn** cleaved her companion in two. **Caelen**’s healing kept the wizard in the fight, allowing **Saffi** to pin the creature down with arrows before Alamira unleashed a devastating icy spell, shattering Marilisaa into frozen shards.

### The Voice from the Grave

Victorious but battered, the party moved deeper into the central cavern. There, the mist parted to reveal a terrifying monument: the colossal, skeletal remains of a dragon.

The silence of the grave was shattered not by a roar, but by a voice—**Draconic**, seemingly ghostly, echoing from the bones themselves. It hissed a threat that chilled the blood more than the cave's damp air.

"Bow down before your new master."

The Fellowship stands before the bones of **Death at Sunset**, the enemy revealed, but the true battle has only just begun.
