# Session 3: The Ghost, The Inheritance, and The Floating Isle

## Overview

The confrontation in the **Lair of Death at Sunset** reached its climax as the party faced the **Voice** and the wormling **"Sunset is Nigh."** With the dragon slain and **Armin** found dead—a tragic cost of the village's safety—the heroes recovered the legendary blade **Leafwarden**. Yet, victory brought only strange rewards: a mysterious inheritance of a wizard's island estate, a journey across the sea, and a vision that would lead them toward fire and tragedy in **Hobbletown**.

## The Chronicle

### The Dragon's Wrath

The disembodied voice hissed its demand: _"Bow down before your new master."_ But the Fellowship bowed to no one. Before them lay the body of **Armin**, his eyes melted by acid—a grim testament to his defiance or perhaps just the cruelty of the beast.

From the fog of the dragon's corpse emerged the "**wormling**," a green dragon designating itself **"Sunset is Nigh."** It unleashed poisonous gas, but the party's inoculations held true. **Tra’Ahn** and **Saffi** struck with steel and arrow, **Alamira** connected with arcing lightning, and **Caelen** brought the fury of the dawn. The wormling, enraged and calling for minions that would not come, was melted by sacred flame—ending the blight's source once and for all.

### Cleaning the Lair

The danger was not quite over. As **Alamira** comforted her trembling spirit fox **Whisper**, the party pushed deeper. They battled infestations of giant insects and sentient, hostile plants—corrupted flora that had overtaken the lair.

Among the hoard, **Tra’Ahn** discovered the prize **Alamira** had sought: **Leafwarden**. The blade, inscribed in Elvish with _"Leafwarden, slayer of dragons, protector of elves,"_ was revealed to be a **Dragon Slayer Longsword**.

But the hoard held more than gold. As Tra’Ahn approached with the **Brass Dragon Egg**, a wave of warmth pulsed from it. The party fell unconscious, plunged into a shared dream of flight and panic—a memory of the egg itself, and a draconic roar commanding, _"You must."_

They awoke with a new understanding: the egg was alive, aware, and guiding them.

### A Bittersweet Return

The party gathered their spoils—including the corpse of the dead wormling, which Tra’Ahn insisted on keeping—and returned to **Red Wood Watch**. The village rejoiced at the lifting of the blight, though **Gwenhomara** was devastated by the news of Armin's death. **Fletcher**, the wolf who had returned with the rescued villagers, seemed to mourn in his own way.

The victory was celebrated, but the party’s eyes were already turning to the horizon.

### The Mysterious Inheritance

The next day, a cold, transactional High Elf named **Daetrius** approached them. She carried a scroll and a message: the party were named inheritors of the **Estate of Eldemir**, an elven wizard who bore a striking resemblance to the woman who gave them the egg. The condition? Whoever holds the egg inherits the estate.

The estate came with a catch—or a benefit. It could be teleported. **Daetrius**, eager to conclude her business, cast the spell that whisked the party away from the forest and onto a remote island estate, miles off the coast.

### Ideally Located (For Now)

The island was a disrepair 5,000-acre marvel, drifting in the ocean. The wizard's tower was weathered, the library filled with outdated books that disappointed **Alamira**. Yet, mysteries abounded. **Tra’Ahn** and **Echo** (Saffi's companion) discovered the island’s foundation was not natural bedrock but earth torn from a mountain—teleported into the sea.

Strange visions continued to plague them. **Tra’Ahn** saw a fire, a kitchen smelling of sweets and rot, and felt a name: **Hobbletown**. **Alamira** recalled the town—a quaint village east of **Daggerford**, known for its bakery.

### To Waterdeep and Beyond

Deciding to head toward **Hobbletown** to investigate the vision, the party realized their island was drifting north while their destination lay southeast. They sailed their rowboat to **Waterdeep**, keeping pace with **Echo** who swam alongside, strangely adapted with gills—a mutation from the island's magic?

In Waterdeep, their stay was brief but eventful. They lodged at the **House of Good Spirits**, resupplied, and had a run-in with a desperate **Halfling** thief trying to sell a stolen **Magical Candle**. **Tra’Ahn** and **Caelen** apprehended the thief, learning he stole it to cure his mother of "mummy rot" (a lie). They turned him over to the guards and returned the candle to the merchant **Lemir**, collecting a bounty.

The journey continued through **Daggerford** and onto the road to **Hobbletown**. But as they crested the hill, the vision became reality. Smoke billowed from the village. Panic filled the air. **Hobbletown** was burning.
