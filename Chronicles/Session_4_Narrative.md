# Session 4: The Baker's Bane and the Candy Curse

## Overview

The vision from the brass dragon egg became a terrifying reality as the Fellowship arrived in **Hobbletown**. Smoke choked the air, and panic reigned. From the ashes of a burning village, a trail of singed grass and half-eaten sweets led them into the surreal and deadly **Candy House**. There, amidst magical traps, animated pastries, and tragic revelations, they uncovered the dark truth of **Enid Appleguard**'s past and came face-to-face with the architect of this madness: **Uncle Nibblecheek**.

## The Chronicle

### Fire and Frosting

The party rushed into the chaos of the burning village. **Tra’Ahn**, smashing through a door, rescued an elderly halfling woman from the flames, while **Caelen** secured the register (and a sentimental picture frame). **Saffi** and **Echo** utilized the village well, coordinating a bucket line that successfully saved the building—a candy shop owned by **Enid Appleguard**.

Enid was grateful but bewildered. She was new to town, and her shop contained no accelerants. Yet, **Saffi** found the clue: a half-eaten cinnabon in the back, a pastry Enid did not bake.

While **Tra’Ahn** chased wild rumors of "flying fire-breathing cows" from a drunk witness, **Alamira** found the truth in the grass: singed tracks leading into the forest. The foliage grew strange and alien as they walked, until they stood before a cottage made entirely of sweets.

### The House of Traps

The **Candy House** was no treat. **Alamira** sensed Conjuration magic on the welcome rug. When **Saffi** attempted to jump over it, she was snatched by a magical snake woven into the fabric. **Tra’Ahn** freed her, tossing the rug aside.

Inside, the house was a carnival of oddities. **Alamira** discovered a bag of lint that, when emptied, transformed into a loyal **badger, weasel, and panther**. But the house had teeth. A pressure plate in the hallway triggered a comically oversized rolling pin, flattening **Tra’Ahn** and **Caelen**.

**Tra’Ahn** suffered the worst of it. The dragonborn was transformed into a **living cookie**—flat, smelling of ginger and molasses, and dangerously susceptible to being eaten (vulnerable to piercing/bite attacks), though his fighting spirit remained broken-but-unbowed.

### Bears, Barns, and Choco-trices

The kitchen held three **Bears** engaged in baking. Negotiations failed when they asked if "Uncle" knew the party was there. The ensuing brawl saw **Tra’Ahn** (the cookie-knight) stuffed into a taffy machine, **Alamira** using illusion magic to confuse the beasts, and **Saffi** and **Echo** taking down the bears with precision.

Exploring the grounds, the party found a barn with a floor of solid chocolate and statues of terrified victims. The guardians here were **Choco-trices** (Chocolate Cockatrices). **Caelen** melted them with devastating radiant light, while **Alamira** froze one solid, shattering its chocolate shell.

### The Grimm Truth

High in the house's tower lair, the party found a library filled with cookbooks and a dark revelation. A storybook depicted a tale of two children, **Enid** and her brother **Asgerd**, who made a pact with a creature named "**Uncle**"—trading the brother for an endless supply of candy. The book spoke of a "**Brioche Bane**" that burns down shops.

It became clear: Enid had not told them everything. She had escaped, but her brother remained.

Among the treasures, **Saffi** found a **Broom of Flying** (identified by Alamira as a Baba Yaga creation) and a bizarre item: a set of chatterbox dentures stuck in a candy apple, which **Alamira** stowed in her bag of tricks.

### The Kitchen Encounter

The final obstacle was **Bubblewoga**, a massive **wooden construct** resembling a baby cyclops. Guarding the kitchen door, he was formidable but simple. The party bribed him with the candy apple found in the library, and the construct happily stepped aside.

The doors swung open to reveal the heart of the rot. There stood **"Uncle Nibblecheek,"** a green-skinned, hag-like figure clutching gingerbread men, and beside him—a **Golden Dragon Wyrmling**.

The "fire-breathing cow" was a dragon. The baker's bane was a child. And the Fellowship stood in the center of the kitchen, ready to end the curse.
