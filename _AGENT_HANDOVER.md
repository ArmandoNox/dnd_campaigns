# AI Agent Handover: Dragon Delves Wiki Maintenance

This document provides the standardized workflow and formatting rules for maintaining the **Dragon Delves** campaign chronicle. Use this to ensure continuity across all future sessions.

## 🌟 The "Premium" Formatting Standard

Every session log should follow the "Session 1 Golden Standard." The structure MUST be as follows:

1.  **Headers**: Use `# Chapter [Ordinal]: [Title]` for the main heading.
2.  **Session Cheat Sheet**: A high-level summary section at the top including:
    - **Dramatis Personae**: NPCs encountered.
    - **Key Items & Quests**: Loot and goals.
    - **Locations & Factions**: Relevant world-building.
    - **Current Objective**: The immediate next step.
3.  **Narrative Style**:
    - **Entity Bolding**: Always **bold** the first mention of Character Names, Key Items, and Locations.
    - **Dividers**: Use `---` between the cheat sheet and the narrative.
    - **Combat Markers**: Demarcate combat with `**_Combat Starts_**` and `**_Combat Ends_**`.
    - **Vital Discoveries**: Highlight key lore with `**[Vital Discovery]**`.
4.  **Navigation Trails**: Every file must end with a footer linking to the previous session, the Master Index, and the next session.

## 📂 Wiki Architecture & Maintenance

Every time a session is added or modified, THREE core files must be updated:

1.  **[README.md](file:///c:/Users/arman/OneDrive/Documents/DnD/Dragon%20Delves%20Campaign%201/docs/README.md)** (Master Index):
    - Add the new session to the log table.
    - Update the "Current Quest Status" (Essences Collected / Next Hoard Location).
2.  **Census (`docs/Census.md`)**:
    - Add new NPCs to "Allies & Companions," "Guardians & Entities," or "Adversaries."
    - Add new landmarks to "Key Landmarks" or "Major Regions."
3.  **Party Ledger (`docs/Ledger.md`)**:
    - Log new magical items and artifacts.
    - Update the "Treas treasury & Valuables" list.
    - Update the "NPC Status Tracker" (e.g., if an ally moves base or an enemy is captured).

## 🛠️ Web Portal Maintenance

Every session update requires matching updates to the web portal in the `/docs` folder:

1.  **Sidebar (`docs/_sidebar.md`)**: Add the new session link under "Chronicles."
2.  **Dashboard (`docs/Dashboard.md`)**: Update the "Active Quest" card and any hero statuses or items gained.
3.  **Links**: Ensure character portals point to the correct D&D Beyond IDs.

---

**Next Immediate Objective**: Integrate the notes for **Session 11** and update the **Dashboard** to reflect the results of the sea cave investigation.
