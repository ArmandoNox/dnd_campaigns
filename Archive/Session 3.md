Chapter Four: The Dragon's Ghost

The session begins as a disembodied voice echoes through the cavern, speaking a direct threat to the heroes as they stand before the skeletal remains of the long-dead dragon, Death at Sunset...

\*(Your notes begin here...)

Dragon bones and a disembodied voice speaks to us “Bow down before your new master”.

We see Armin laying on the floor in front of it.

Tra’ahn attempts to negotiate with the dragon spirit who seems ready to attack.

Dragon is proud, and doesn’t consider Tra’ahn, who is a halfing.

We notice what appears to be acidic breath coming from near the center of the corpse.

Alamira attempts to push the fog with some air coming from her hands.

However that only seemed to upset the dragon.

Caelen and Tra’ahn approach Armin and realize his eyes were melted by acid.

**_Combat starts_**

with an enrage smaller green dragon (the wormling Sunset is nigh) coming from the bones.

the dragon unleashes poisonous gas at Caelen at Tra’ahn, hurting them gravely but the prior antidote/inoculation helped reduce the damage.

As the dragon stepped back into the fog, Saffi takes a shot that while difficult, lands on her target and then she steps into cover. As the dragon growls and calls for his minions.

Alamira takes a chance with Witch Bolt, which misses the target, but connects the two nonetheless.

Tra’ahn moves forward over the bones to take a swing at the dragon, and lands a slice at the dragon.

Caelen heals himsels and steps slightly away so we are not bunched up together and casts shield of faith on Tra’ahn.

the dragon attempts to slash with his claws at Tra’ahn, but he blocks the damage completely.

Safi comes out of cover and takes a shot that once again lands on her target.

Alamira’s Witch bolt strkes the dragon as she casts Ray of Frost, both spells landing on the dragon as he growls in pain.

Tra’ahn very skillfully dodges the arrow and spells, and takes a slash at the dragon and lands his strike.

Caelen uses his Sacred Flame spell and lands a radiant flame on the dragon melting his flesh and killing him on the spot.

**_Combat ends_**

Alamira hugs her spirit fox, Whisper for comfort as she’s trembling and recovering from the sudden panic of encountering a dragon.

Saffi approaches Armin to glance over his body. She expresses curiosity to know what happened to Fletcher, his dog.

Alamira glances around to see if she spots any dog body. Saffi however makes note that there’s no tracks that would suggest the dog didn’t come in.

Tra’ahn and Caelen start to investigate further into the lair, and Caelen curves around the corner, and notices an area with bright, flourescent mushrooms, and what appears to be the insects that we had encountered before at the tree.

Alamira asks Whisper to keep watch, while Tra’ahn and Alamira take a look at some treasure that was behind the dragon’s corpse.

However, Saffi and Caelen approach the bug infested mushrooms and get attacked by the insects.

**_combat starts_**

Caelen attacks the first bug landing a heavy damaging blow.

The bugs attempt to bite at Saffi but aren’t successful.

Saffi then pulls her scimitars, and slashes at the centipede, and chops it in half. Afterwards, she slices at the swarm of bugs and just barely lands her attack killing a handful of them.

Tra’ahn, hearing Saffi screaming he rushes at the remaining bugs killing most of them with a slash of his sword.

Alamira casts ray of frost in an attempt to kill the remaining but instead barely misses Tra’ahn.

Caelen then proceeds to attack them but there are still some remaining.

the swarm finally jumps at Saffi and manage to hurt her slightly. Saffi retaliates taking a Z shaped slash at them, finishing them off.

**_combat ends_**

While the rest of the team verifies the end of the lair, Saffi takes some of the mushrooms and stores it in her backpack.

However, as Caelen and Tra’ahn delve slightly deeper to check the last corner, where the mushrooms were, they get attacked by bugs again.

**_combat starts_**

Saffi quickly takes a shot at the biggest centipede, and quickly disposes it.

The bugs attempt to attack Caelen, but are unable to, as Caelen uses Sacred Flame and kills many of them.

Tra’ahn takes a slash killing a handful, as Alamira rushes to join the party and casts Ray of Frost only killing a handful.

Saffi takes another shot killing the remaining.

**_combat ends_**

Now the team approaches the treasure pile and notice a magnificent sword sticking out of the pile of treasure and gems.

Saffi prepares her Detect Magic, and while we wait for her we start going through the treasure. Meanwhile We feel a warmth coming from the dragon egg that Tra’ahn was carrying.

As he approaches the egg to the treasure trove, the warmth feels stronger and stronger, and suddenly we are unconcious. We feel like we in a dream. We feel like we are being held by a friendly being. however, we also feel like we are in danger. We feel a similar panic and anxiety of the same night when the caravan was destroyed. However, we feel like we are flying instead of at the caravan.

You yell at the creature carrying you “but i can’t do this alone” And the dragon roaring at you in response, says “You must” as you suddenly start falling and we all wake up.

We start to ponder about the mission and how we found the egg. We conclude that we felt what the egg was feeling moments before we found it. We also no longer feel the wamrth emanating from it.

Saffi proceeds to hug the egg and comfort it. The eggs responds with a slight warm at her.

Tra’ahn takes the sword, and starts reading the inscriptions which are in elvish, which roughly translates to “Leafwarden, slayer of dragons, protector of elves”. Saffi finds out it is a Dragon Slayer enchanted longsword.

Amongts the items, they found the ones below: \*

210 GP, 3,150 SP, 6,300 CP Twelve moonstones (worth 50 GP each) Jade orb (worth 100 GP) engraved in Infernal with the name of Stygia Golden cup (worth 50 GP) Hand mirror in a silver frame (worth 40 GP) Ivory comb (worth 35 GP) Dust of Disappearance Keoghtom’s Ointment Potion of Giant Strength (hill) Spell Scroll of Web.

Alamira telephatically communicated with Whisper to check the last area of the lair.

Meanwhile, Alamira and Tra’ahn talk about the history of the sword Leafwarden.

While we hadn’t heard the name of it before, we did hear about a green dragon that was slain by an enlvish sword wielded by a hero that had perished in battle.

Tra’ahn practices a few swing with the sword before we head on to check the final corner of the lair.

As Caelen gets closer to that corner he makes note that there’s some creatures he’s detecting there.

Tra’ahn and Caelen take the lead while Saffi and Alamira stay back.

Meanwhile the roots that Whisper had previously spotted start moving and cackle as they approach with hostility.

**_ combat starts_**

Alamira, already on edge with all the fighting immediately uses Witch bolt, electrocuting the larger of the two.

Tra’ahn takes a slash at it as well, finishing it off. Echo who had joined us shortly after our last battle with the bugs, takes a step back before charging at the last plant creature standing. instantly killing it.

**_ Combat ends_**

We don’t find anything of interest in the last room.

While we make our way back to the skeleton of the dragon, Tra’ahn follows a trail of coins leading towards the corpse of Death at Sunset.

Tra’ahn makes note that it seems that Death at Sunset had pulled the sword out from and left in the hoard before dying as he also spots the egg where Susnet is nigh came out from, and the body of Sunset at nigh that we had killed before.

Tra’ahn pulls the baby dragon’s body outside of the poisonous mist of its parent and takes it outside the cave. With the mindset of potentially using it’s scales to carve something for himself later.

On our way out, we still don’t see any sign of Fletcher.

We also approach Caynen to let us know about our success. Saffi asks him if he notices anything different. But he seems to show no care for anything but his tree. Tra’ahn lets Caynen know we would be coming back. And Saffi asks him about Fletcher. Caynen states he last saw him going towards the town.

The team then makes their way back to Redwood Watch.

Tra’ahn talks about the variety of dragons, and slightly discusses their hostility levels.

Alamira determines she will read some books in order to figure our next destination, while Tra’ahn mentions that maybe the egg will let us know.

Arriving at Redwood Watch, they are approached immediately by the members of the council. Also generally a celebratory mood across the town. Gwen immediately seems devastated. Saffi asks about Fletcher, and Celenar mentions that the dog returned with the 4 villagers. Alamira makes observation about how Fletcher might’ve escorted the villagers while Armin took the punishment.

Saffi goes into detail as she excitedly explains about the bugs, and mushrooms and the encounter with Sunset is nigh.

Tra’ahn does express interest in getting back the corpse of the dragon. He asks about a bard or poet that could write about our adventures, but is disappointed in finding out there’s none.

Alamira asks’a bout books, but Celenar makes note that Sunny Lightpurse might have books. Alamira makes note that maybe she also knows about the other dragon’s locations.

After recovering the body and making their way back to town,

Saffi finds Fletcher, and casts “Speak with Animals” to speak with him. She tries to see if Fletcher knows about Armin, but upon finding out he doesn’t know but is focused on the food. She pats him and lets him be.

They all celebrate before finally resting for the day.

The next day, they approach Sunny. They spot Gwen speaking with an elf that we don’t recognize. Upon spotting the adventurers, the elf approaches the team. Her name is Daetrius. Upon hearing our names, she invokes a scroll out of thin air, and writes something on the scroll.

She states we are the inheritors of Eldemir’s estate, a wizard elvish looking woman that seemed to resemble the person in the cave that handed us the dragon. Tra’ahn is confused, because we had just met. It is impossible for us to be inheritors.

She reads the will and documentation, basically stating that whoever holds the eggs inherits the estate. We can also teleport the estate whenever we want. Once her service is concluded, we can find her later for further business in Neverwinter.

Saffi ravages her with a variety of questions. but the elf seems rather business oriented.

After her interrogation, Saffi urges the group to privately discuss the situation.

With the inheritance, we can -one time- teleport to the estate. And also -one time- teleport the estate to a location of our preference.

But given that it’s 6 miles from the coast at an island, we don’t know how we would get back.

Nonetheless, after returning to the elf, they determine to clear out the details a little more.

Ultimately, before heading out to the Estate, they decide to talk to Sunny first before leaving.

The team bought some generally useful items from Sunny, like potions, armor and such.

Tra’ahn and saffi, however are at a stalemate due to the dragon, and the potential of making some armor out of its scales. But Saffi disagrees, and thinks we should leave it to the town to rebuild.

Ultimately, most agree to take the dragon’s body as “payment” and a relunctact Saffi agrees.

the team heads back to the elf after preparing for the trip to the estate. The elf starts an incantation, and there’s a sudden flash and the team is teleported to the estate.

the team finds themselves at the edge of an island, and the smell of salt from the ocean.

They can spot the coast, and notice the island is not too high over water level.

The island apparently teleports at times.

We make our way through a forest towards the estate, the island being 5k acres. However, upon finding the building it’s weathered down,and partly broken down and in need of care.

It appeared to have been a wizard’s tower. But only two floors remain, and there’s gaps in the ceiling, completely exposed to the outside.

Saffi asks if there’s anything besides the dock and the tower, but according to the elf there’s nothing else.

Alamira keeps looking eagerly at all the books. Out of date, hundreds of years old, and things that have already been discovered. Alamira is slightly disappointed.

Tra’ahn asks Alamira abouts the books, and she explains about the books being old and common information these days.

Afterwards Tra’ahn places the eggs on a table, and suddenly see a vision of the elf that had given them the egg, muttering to herself, with a book in hand until she eventually fades away.

Saffi places Detect Magic and notices the tower has a vibe of magic around it. alamira makes notes that maybe it is all an illusion.

Alamira and Tra’ahn make their way to the second floor, and the egg once against provides an image. This time of a dragon perched on the tower, looking down at Eldemir’s the elf owner of this tower. Tra’ahn notices that the dragon on the image is a brass dragon, and Saffi and Tra’ahn think that it might be Eggmiradal’s mother.

Saffi decides to speak to the egg. The eggs resonates with a feeling that Saffi interprets as “home”.

After not finding anything else of interest. The team makes their way to the dock, which seems relatively simple and a small boat, and oar driven boat.

After not finding anything of interest at the dock. The team walks around the island, but for the most part they find nothing.

Over the trip, the team discusses where they could be But there’s no immediate landmarks to tell. Alamira does note that the island seems to be drifting very slowly and also wonders…if maybe a creature is moving the island.

The team returns to the tower, and spend some time together while Tra’ahn plays his flute, and Alamira narrates stories until the team goes to sleep.

Tra’ahn is taking first watch overnight, and roughly at the end of his watch and he approaches Alamira to wake her up for the second watch.

However, as Tra’ahn attempts to touch her shoulder, he gets another vision of fire surrounding him and someone screaming for help, and this vision spreads to the others in their dreams. Suddenly the vision shifts, and you’re trying to track something big in panic in the forest. Suddenly again, the vision shifts to a kitchen, with a smell of sweet things and also something rotten. Suddenly another shift, to a vision of a town, peaceful, to which everyone in the team “feels” the name. Hobbletown.

tra’ahn discusses the visions with Alamira.

Alamira tells him that by-chance she had a teacher talk about an amazing bakery, at the quaint village of hobbletown. And she remembers that east of daggerford on the delimbyir river.

Morning next day the team discusses with Alamira her knowledge of the town.

Saffi makes note of Echo being slightly different. For some reason he has what looks like gills.

Everyone agrees to make their way to the dock, to look underwater. tra’ahn notices that Echo seems to be moving more like a seal, rather than a wolf. Saffi expresses that she had been thinking about what Alamira mentioned about looking underwater to see how the island moved.

The general conclusion being that the island had some magic, dragon magic that might’ve caused this.

Tra’ahn removes some of his equipment to keep himself light, and Echo jumps in the water happily ad being able to move freely. He then lets Tra’ahn mount him and they suddenly go in the water.

They notice that the island is not attached to anything. But Tra’ahn notices that the rocks and earth underneath are not meant to be on water, rather they seem to belong to land.

Tra’ahn returns to the team. And explains his findings. They think that it belongs to a mountain, and that the island was forcebly teleported to the water. Alamira expresses some disapointment at not finding a giant turtle underneath it and moving it.

The team eventually makes their way to the coast on the boat as Caelen and Tra’ahn row the boat, Saffi stays on the front looking for anything of interest.

Saffi casually shoots an arm from the tree creatures they had previously defeated so echo could play Fetch with her as they kept rowing towards the coast.

Saffi keeps a lookout to see if she spots anything familiar, and she spots what appears to be the swordmountains slightly to the north. Which she mentions that by the landmark, we should be between waterdeep and the Mere of Dead Men.

the team ponders about potentially losing sight of the island.

Alamira points out that she could ask her father about moving to the island to her hometown, which is northeast.

But the elf that teleported them is north, to Neverwinter.

And our goal is southeast towards Hobbletown.

the team eventually decides to go to Waterdeep on their way to Hobbletown, taking the boat south to keep up with Echo along the coast.

We approach Waterdeep and dock our rowboat, which is generally a trade town, but it’s unorthodox to land on a simple rowboat.

As we get off the rowboat, someone approaches us to charge us for the place. Meanwhile Alamira reads his thoughts and notices that he wants to flip the boat for 25 to Blarnes. Alamira whispers to Tra’ahn about this so he can bargain a better deal. disappointed, the person, dismisses us.

We rent the dock for the rowboat for 3 gold, and decide to find an inn for the night.

We ask around for an inn, and we get a variety of good locations.

We end up going to the “House of Good Spirits”. Which serves basic food, and a cheap stay.

We ask around for simpler things like a cartographer, Blarnes, horses, etc.

We end up buying a map for 1 gold, and ponder on the horse transportation. Tra’ahn ends up jaggling for the transportation and gets a 15% discount.

As Caelen and Tra’ahn are shopping a halfling approaches them, and suddenly lowers himself on his knees. Begging for money, and trying to sell a magical candle for 500 gold.

After we let him know we don’t have the gold, he drops the price to 200 gold.

Tra’ahn ponders with Saffi, and asks her to check if it’s magical in nature, which after her detect magic, she determines it is indeed magical, and it’s nature is in transmutation.

Caelen on the other hand, notices the halfling is desperate to get rid of the item.

Mummy rot is what the halfling expressed his mother was and that’s why he’s desperate to sell the candle.

Alamira had tried to prod his mind for answer and his feelings express frustration and annoyance.

Caelen mentions that Mummy’s rot is not real, and the halfling attempts to run away. Tra’ahn easily grabs him, and questions his intentions about offloading the candle.

tra’ahn tries to intimidate him into telling us. Successfully getting information from him. He confesses he stole it.

However, the halfling manages to run at which point casts phantasmal force in order to scare the halfling to a halt.

The team captures him again and Caelen takes the candle from him because they can’t abide by theft.

Suddenly we see the townsguards approaching, and they claim that they were looking for the halfling, and tell us how they were looking for him and the candle he stole.

It appears he had a bounty on his head for the theft. To which Saffi asks if he can tell us from whom he stole from the candle.

The team then heads to claim their bounty for the gold, and also approach the merchant from which the candle was stolen. The guards

The merchant Lemir, tells us his name after Tra’ahn asks him his name. Apparently the candle makes some spells easier. Alamira approached the merchant as he was trying to head out, and tries to negotiate for a teleportation spell or item, both which are very expensive and unable to buy now.

the team rests, and then travel through Daggerford, on their way to Hobble town.

As the team approaches Hobbletown, they notice smoke coming out of town, and cries of panic and help.

Tra’ahn makes notes about the prior vision not being a memory, but rather something that is happening right now.

The group spots the houses burning as they rush towards the town.
