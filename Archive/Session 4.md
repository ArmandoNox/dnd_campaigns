Chapter Five: The Burning of Hobbletown

The vision from the dragon egg became a terrifying reality. As the heroes crested the final hill before Hobbletown, they were met not with the quaint village Alamira remembered from stories, but with a scene of chaos. Smoke billowed into the sky, and the panicked screams of halflings echoed across the fields. A candy shop at the edge of town was engulfed in flames. Without a moment's hesitation, the party charged into the fray.

As they neared the inferno, Alamira instinctively shaped the flames, creating a brief, clear path to the front door. Tra’Ahn didn’t need a second invitation, shattering the door as he burst inside. Through the smoke, he spotted an elderly halfling woman, her face a mask of terror. He scooped her into his arms and carried her to safety outside. Caelen followed, ducking into the burning shop to search for others, emerging moments later with the cash till and a framed picture.

Meanwhile, Saffi and Echo had located the town well. With a bucket brigade quickly formed by the party and some brave villagers, they managed to douse the flames, saving the building from total collapse. The rescued halfling, introducing herself as Enid Appleguard, thanked them profusely. She was new to town and utterly baffled by the fire's origin, as her shop used no open flames.

The investigation began. At Enid’s direction, Saffi examined the back of the store where the fire had been strongest and found a curious clue: a half-eaten cinnabon, a pastry Enid didn't sell. While the party questioned the locals, Tra’Ahn heard a rambling tale from a drunk woman about "fire-breathing cows." Though he dismissed it, Alamira noticed singed grass in the direction the woman had pointed. The party followed the tracks, which led them deep into the woods along a trail bordered by strangely out-of-place foliage. Their path ended at a fantastical, impossible sight: a house made almost entirely of candy.

Chapter Six: The House of Sweet Horrors

The air grew colder as they approached the confectionery cottage. While Saffi scouted the perimeter, Alamira, Tra’Ahn, and Caelen moved toward the front door. Alamira's Detect Magic revealed a powerful conjuration aura emanating from the welcome mat, which bore the inscription, "Please, wipe your feet." After cautiously testing the rug with no effect, Alamira opened the door, revealing a whimsical interior. The three stepped inside, respecting the magical warning. Saffi, ever skeptical, attempted to leap over the mat.

Combat: The Rug of Smothering

As Saffi jumped, the rug's woven pattern animated, lashing out like a serpent and grappling her to the ground. Tra’Ahn reacted instantly, prying the animated rug off his companion. The rug then attempted to ensnare the dragonborn, but he deftly sidestepped its attack, balled it up, and tossed it outside. Caelen and Alamira slammed the door shut, hearing a final, frustrated thump before silence fell.

With the immediate threat handled, the party explored the initial rooms. In a child's nursery, Caelen found a large cradle inscribed with the name "Bubblewoga." In the same room, Alamira’s magic detected a strange bag. Reaching inside, she found only lint, which she emptied onto the floor. The lint balls instantly transformed into a badger, a weasel, and a panther, who seemed to accept Alamira as their new master. Meanwhile, in the living room, Saffi noted that a kettle on the fireplace seemed to have been placed there recently.

Their investigation was cut short when the group proceeded into the main hallway. Tra’Ahn stepped on a pressure plate, triggering an oversized rolling pin that swung down and flattened Alamira and Caelen into cookie-like versions of themselves. A quick heal from Caelen mended their cracks, but their flattened forms remained.

The next door opened into a kitchen where three large bears were busy baking. Startled by the intrusion, they questioned the party, asking if "Uncle" knew they were here. When negotiations failed, the bears turned hostile.

Combat: The Baking Bears

Tra’Ahn held the doorway, shield raised. Despite his defensive stance, one of the bears managed to grab him and shove him into a nearby taffy-pulling machine. Alamira cast Phantasmal Force, creating illusions that distracted one bear while her new panther companion attacked another. Caelen unleashed a blast of radiant energy, searing the bears, and Saffi and Echo charged in, arrows and claws finding their marks. After a chaotic exchange of blows, two bears lay dead, and the last was knocked unconscious. As Tra'Ahn climbed out of the taffy machine, he found himself transformed into a slightly flexible, sweet-tasting version of himself.

The party interrogated the surviving bear. He revealed their master was "Uncle Nibblecheek" and that they were under orders to kill any intruders. He knew little else, except that the large, wooden baby cyclops was a bodyguard for whatever lay at the end of the house.

Following a hallway, they discovered a bizarre backyard. Four candy Dryads stared silently from their trees as the party passed. Tra'Ahn asked if they could pass and if they liked "Uncle," but the single-minded fey barely responded, only caring that their apples remained untouched. The party continued into a barnyard made of solid chocolate, filled with the petrified statues of past visitors in expressions of terror.

Combat: The Choco-trices

Four chocolate-covered cockatrices turned on the party. The fight was swift and decisive. Caelen's radiant magic melted them, Alamira's frost shattered one, and Tra’Ahn and Saffi dispatched the rest with blade and arrow.

Saffi's magic led them up a spiral staircase to a library. Among the baking books, they found a grim fairy tale. It told the story of a young Enid Appleguard and her brother, Asgerd, who made a pact with "Uncle"—trading the brother for an unlimited supply of candy. The book ended with a chilling prophecy of a "Brioche Bane" who would burn the sweet shop down. They also discovered a magical Broom and a set of chattering dentures stuck in a candy apple.

Finally, they reached the last section of the house, guarded by the large, wooden baby cyclops, Bubblewoga. The creature simply stated that it could not allow them into the kitchen. After a brief negotiation, the party successfully bribed it with the candy apple they had found, and the guard stepped aside. They opened the door to the kitchen. There, they found him: "Uncle" Nibblecheek, standing beside a golden dragon no bigger than a wyrmling. The session ended as the final confrontation was about to begin.
